Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers are able to access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it "never easier to organize and analyze the data." We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data. The CoinAPI Market Data API provides access to market data for cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies through three main interfaces: RESTful, WebSocket, and FIX. The RESTful interface is a stateless, request-response API that provides a wide range of data but is not capable of streaming. The WebSocket and FIX interfaces are stateful, publish-subscribe APIs that provide real-time market data streaming. The CoinAPI SDK is available on GitHub and includes libraries and examples for a variety of programming languages. It is recommended to use the SDK libraries instead of creating new ones, but contributions to the SDK are encouraged. The use of encryption on the API is optional and the decision to use it is left to the user. The API uses protocols that are considered best security practices on encrypted endpoints.

EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API. The Execution Management System (EMS) API is a software product that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient and cost-effective manner. It allows users to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a unified API. The EMS API can be used in two ways: Managed Cloud, where everything is hosted and managed by CoinAPI, and Self-Hosted, where the software is provided by CoinAPI but hosted and managed by the user. The EMS API has several benefits and features, including low latency support for high-frequency trading and market making, a normalized API abstraction that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of data models and protocols, and support for multiple industry-standard protocols such as REST, WebSocket, FIX 4.4/5.0, and FIXT 1.1. The EMS API also supports self-hosting or deployment in the cloud, multi-account management, and comprehensive support for all market types and order types. The EMS API has a well-defined order lifecycle, with specific order statuses and transitions between them. Orders can have different parameters, including order type (currently only LIMIT orders are supported), time in force, and execution instructions. The EMS API also uses the ISO 8601 standard for input and output time values, and assumes UTC time zone if no time zone information is supplied.

CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a "pay as you go" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate with each other. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.

customerportal.coinapi.io - The customerportal.coinapi.io serves as a centralized platform for clients to manage various aspects of their CoinAPI account. This portal offers a user-friendly interface with key options accessible through a left-hand menu:
