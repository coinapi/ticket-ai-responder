The Execution Management System (EMS) API is a software product that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient and cost-effective manner. It allows users to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a unified API. The software can be used in two ways: Managed Cloud and Self-Hosted. The Managed Cloud option is recommended for users who want a fast and easy setup, while the Self-Hosted option is recommended for users who require more control and customization. The EMS API provides low latency support, normalized API abstraction, industry standard protocols, and multi-account support. It also offers comprehensive support, high availability, and P&L and asset monitoring. The EMS API is self-hosted and fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. It is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box and can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations. The software consists of several components, including the Exchange, CoinAPI EMS Edge, CoinAPI EMS API, CoinAPI EMS WebUI, and the Customer Application. The EMS API also provides an order lifecycle and order parameters, including order type, time in force, and execution instructions. The software supports a wide range of time in force values and execution instructions, and it also provides a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination. The EMS API also provides a comprehensive configuration manual, installation manual, and management guide. The software can be configured using command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration providers. It can be installed using an executable, running on Docker, or running on a Kubernetes Cluster. The software is compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, macOS, and Windows. The EMS API also provides a WebSocket API for real-time communication capacity for order management, execution reports, balances, and positions. The WebSocket API provides real-time communication capacity for order management, execution reports, balances, and positions. It is an alternative to the REST API and provides a more efficient and low-latency communication channel. The WebSocket API uses the JSON protocol for message encoding and decoding. The API provides a set of messages for order management, execution reports, balances, and positions. The messages are defined in the Messages section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of endpoints for connecting to the EMS API. The endpoints are defined in the Endpoints section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of authentication methods for securing the communication channel. The authentication methods are defined in the Authentication section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of error messages for handling errors and exceptions. The error messages are defined in the Error Messages section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of performance metrics for monitoring the performance of the EMS API. The performance metrics are defined in the Performance Metrics section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of deployment options for deploying the EMS API. The deployment options are defined in the Deployment section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of integration and plugin options for integrating the EMS API with other systems and applications. The integration and plugin options are defined in the Integrations & Plugins section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of Prometheus metrics for monitoring the performance of the EMS API. The Prometheus metrics are defined in the Prometheus Metrics section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of deployment tools for deploying and managing the EMS API. The deployment tools are defined in the Deployment section of the documentation. The API also provides a set of changelog for tracking the changes and updates to the EMS API. The changelog is defined in the Changelog section of the documentation.
