5,i.io ,"i.io .   Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?‚ÄãCoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission‚ÄãCoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio‚ÄãCoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is very handy for researchers that are not much familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers are able to access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate with each other. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?‚ÄãCoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real-time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can actually use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data.

CoinAPI offers easy access to a wide range of financial information, encompassing both live and historical data from various exchanges. Whether you‚Äôre looking for detailed trading data, OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), or specific event information, CoinAPI delivers. CoinAPI provides crypto order book data, making it one of the best crypto APIs available. Additionally, our support for multiple data delivery methods, including REST and WebSocket, makes it highly versatile for developers creating trading algorithms or crypto market data visualizations.Let's Begin üöÄ‚ÄãHarnessing the capabilities of CoinAPI, a robust cryptocurrency API, alongside Python, known for its versatility in data analysis and statistical computing, we can delve deeply into the nuances of the cryptocurrency market.We‚Äôll walk you through the steps to fetch and analyze crypto order book data in real-time, leveraging the comprehensive data provided by the cryptocurrency API.Setting Up the API Request‚ÄãTo fetch real-time order book data, you'll first need an API key from CoinAPI website. Once you have it, you can proceed to retrieve the data using Python.Fetching the dataimport requestsimport jsonAPI_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE""url = f""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/orderbooks/current?symbol=KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD&apikey={API_KEY}""response = requests.get(url)if response.status_code == 200: # The request was successful data = response.json()  # Save the data to a file with open(""order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"", ""w"") as file:  json.dump(data, file, indent=4) print(""Data saved to order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"")else: # Handle error cases print(f""Error: Status code {response.status_code}"") print(response.text)Response{ ""symbol_id"": ""KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD"", ""time_exchange"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""time_coinapi"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""asks"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.1,   ""size"": 19.23618731  },  {   ""price"": 37549.9,   ""size"": 0.08242079  },  /// other entries omitted for brevity ], ""bids"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.0,   ""size"": 0.136004  },  {   ""price"": 37545.1,  }  /// other entries omitted for brevity ]}Data Analysis and Metrics‚ÄãUpon data retrieval, the next step involves data analysis using Python. The obtained data typically represents a snapshot of buy and sell orders in the market at a specific moment. This data consists of two key components: bids and asks. Bids signify the price levels at which buyers are willing to acquire an asset, while asks represent the price levels at which sellers are willing to sell it. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is referred to as the spread.Here is a comprehensive list of common metrics and analytical procedures:Order Book Depth - visualize the liquidity available at various price levels.Order Imbalance - analyze the disparity between bids and asks to gain insights into market sentiment.Price Levels - identify significant price levels characterized by substantial volumes of bids or asks.Market Spread - compute the current bid-ask spread as an indicator of market liquidity.Order Book Depth Visualization‚ÄãIn this Python code, we demonstrate how to visualize the order book depth of a cryptocurrency trading pair using Matplotlib.import jsonimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to visualize order book depth chartdef visualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  bid_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in bids] bid_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in bids]  ask_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in asks] ask_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in asks]  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(bid_prices, bid_sizes, label=""Bids (buyers)"", color=""green"") plt.plot(ask_prices, ask_sizes, label=""Asks (sellers)"", color=""red"") plt.xlabel(""Price"") plt.ylabel(""Size"") plt.title(""Order Book Depth"") plt.legend() plt.show()# Visualize the order book depthvisualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data)The following visualization is the result of the Python script demonstrated above.Order Book Depth Visualization:is a measure of the quantity of buy and sell orders available for a particular financial assetit provides insight into market liquidity and the willingness of traders to buy or sell at different pricesmay be used for trading decisions, as it reveals potential price trendsOrder Imbalance, Price Levels, Market Spread‚ÄãIn this Python code, we explore order imbalance, significant bids & asks, market spread metrics for a BTC/USD trading pair.import json# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to calculate order imbalancedef calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data): bids = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""bids""]) asks = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""asks""]) order_imbalance = (bids - asks) / (bids + asks) return order_imbalance# Function to identify significant price levelsdef identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, threshold=50): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  significant_bids = [entry for entry in bids if entry[""size""] > threshold] significant_asks = [entry for entry in asks if entry[""size""] > threshold] return significant_bids, significant_asks# Function to calculate market spreaddef calculate_market_spread(order_book_data): best_bid = order_book_data[""bids""][0][""price""] best_ask = order_book_data[""asks""][0][""price""]  spread = best_ask - best_bid return spread# Common metrics calculationorder_imbalance = calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data)significant_price_threshold = 20significant_bids, significant_asks = identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, significant_price_threshold)spread = calculate_market_spread(order_book_data)print(""******************************"")print(""Order Imbalance:"", order_imbalance)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Bids:"", significant_bids)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Asks:"", significant_asks)print(""***************************"")print(""Market Spread:"", spread)print(""***************************"")Result> ******************************> Order Imbalance: -0.012400502029283922> ***************************> Significant Bids: [{'price': 37440.7, 'size': 24.73909889}, {'price': 36451.0, 'size': 25.0}]> ***************************> Significant Asks: [{'price': 37749.0, 'size': 25.0}, {'price': 37840.0, 'size': 24.08119208}, {'price': 38000.0, 'size': 29.60579175}, {'price': 39000.0, 'size': 21.75395535}, {'price': 40000.0, 'size': 58.28620718}]> ***************************> Market Spread: 0.09999999999854481> ***************************Calculated metrics:order_imbalance - it measures the difference between the total volume of buy orders and sell orders.

It helps traders focus on specific price points that may have a more substantial impact on the market.significant_bids and significant_asks are lists of price levels derived from the order book data that meet or exceed the significant_price_threshold. These levels are typically associated with higher trading activity and may be seen as key support and resistance levels.spread is a metric that calculates the difference between the best bid and best ask prices. It represents the cost of executing a market order and is a fundamental factor for traders to consider when entering or exiting positions.Summary‚ÄãThis tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge and tools necessary to fetch and analyze cryptocurrency order book data using CoinAPI and Python. You've learned how to access real-time order book information, visualize order book depth and calculate important metrics. Armed with this understanding, you are now better prepared to explore and navigate the cryptocurrency markets, enabling you to make more informed trading decisions and develop data-driven trading strategies.

In this guide, we will specifically concentrate on extracting data in CSV (comma-separated-values) format using simple approach that involves accessing data directly through web browser. CSV is widely used due to its simplicity and compatibility with various spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.Getting started‚ÄãBefore diving into the tutorial, ensure you have:Web browser installed: google chrome, firefox, microsoft edge or any otherA CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)Spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or Google SheetsRetrieve BTC Exchange Rates in csv format via web browser‚ÄãIt is possible to control format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters. To get BTC exchange rates in csv format, copy and paste below URL to address bar of your web browser:https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY-ed802af4-e855-4505-AEA&output_format=csvNote: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Simple then press ctrl+a or command+a to select exchange rates, then press ctrl + c to copy data. After obtaining the data, you can seamlessly paste it directly into any text editor.Then, select Save As option, and don't forget to include the .csv file extension.CSV import: Microsoft Excel‚ÄãTo import the .csv file into the MS Excel application, navigate to the Data tab, and choose the From Text/CSV option.Select your .csv file which includes BTC exchange rate data in csv format.Verify the output of import in preview window.With these simple steps, you can now efficiently work with and analyze the market data in a familiar spreadsheet environment, empowering you to make informed decisions based on the exchange rate information. CSV import: Google Sheets‚ÄãTo import the .csv file into the Google Sheets application, navigate to the File menu.Within that menu, select Import option.Upload your .csv file which includes BTC exchange rate data.Make sure to set correct Import location and Separator type, then press Import data.Here's the final result:With these simple steps, you can now efficiently work with and analyze the market data in a familiar spreadsheet environment, empowering you to make informed decisions based on the exchange rate information. Summary‚ÄãWe have explored a simple approach to access market data in CSV format directly through a web browser. By utilizing this method, you can easily extract the data you need for analysis and integrate it with various spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.While the simple approach through a web browser provides easy access to market data in csv format, there is cryptotick specialized platform that offer a wide range of market data types in csv format, including quotes, trades, limit order book, OHLCV and other.Happy data exploration!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousImport API into PostmanNextReal-time data visualization with javascriptIntroductionGetting startedRetrieve BTC Exchange Rates in csv format via web browserCSV import: Microsoft ExcelCSV import: Google SheetsSummaryCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

""BTC/USD 1 / (USDC/USD) = BTC/USD USD/USDC = BTC/USDC""Reconnect IN‚ÄãReconnect message is sent by the server to all connected clients when the server will be restarted or shut down at the defined exact time included in the message content. After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"": ""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"",}Message variables‚ÄãVariableDescriptiontypeMessage type, always reconnectwithin_secondsSeconds within which reconnection should be performed.before_timeTime before which reconnection should be performed.Heartbeat IN‚ÄãHeartbeat message JSON is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""hearbeat""}Heartbeat message is sent to you every time there is one second of silence in communication between us, if you agreed on this feature in Hello message.tipWebSocket working on TCP protocol which doesn‚Äôt have the feature indicating that the connection is broken without trying exchange data over it.

This tutorial walks you through the process of using CoinAPI's API to access exchange rates data using Python, Javascript and Java. The objective here is to equip you with the necessary know-how to utilize our API for your crypto projects.Prerequisites‚ÄãA CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)A basic understanding of at least one programming language: Python, Javascript or JavaAPI Key Generation‚ÄãBefore we dive into code, it's crucial to understand that to use the CoinAPI, you need an API key. This key identifies your application and authorizes requests.Visit the CoinAPI website.Register an account or login if you already have one.Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.Remember to store your key safely - it's your credential!Making an API Request with Python‚ÄãTo connect to CoinAPI in Python, we'll use the requests library. If you don't have the 'requests' library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example of access-coinapi-data.py python script:import requestsdef fetch_data():url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD""headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR-API-KEY"" # Replace with your API key}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)return response.json()print(fetch_data())This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. To execute script, run python access-coinapi-data.py command.> python access-coinapi-data.py{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Javascript‚ÄãMakes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. Add package.json with node-fetch module dependency.{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Create file access-coinapi-data.js with following code:import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD', {headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This example fetches the current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Install dependencies via npm install command. Execute your program in nodejs runtime environment with node access-coinapi-data.js command.> node access-coinapi-data.js{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Java‚ÄãMake sure to install Java Development Kit (JDK) as it includes runtime environment (JRE) plus additional tools and utilities required for Java development. To check whether JRE and JDK are already installed on your system you may use java -version command.Java offers multiple ways to send HTTP requests. Here we'll use the HttpURLConnection class. Create Main.java file with following content:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. Use javac Main.java command to compile java source file into bytecode. Resulting bytecode file will be named Main.class. After the compilation step, you can execute the program using java Main to see the exchange rate output.> javac Main.Java> java Main{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Understanding the Response‚ÄãCoinAPI returns data in JSON format, which we convert to a Python dictionary using response.json(). The /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint response includes:time: The timestamp of the last data update.asset_id_base: The base asset (in our case, BTC).asset_id_quote: The quote asset (in our case, USD).rate: The current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Converting Between Cryptocurrencies‚ÄãThe /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint retrieves the current exchange rate of BTC to USD. Additionally, the Exchange Rates endpoint provides the flexibility to obtain exchange rates between BTC and various other assets, allowing users to access the conversion rates for multiple asset pairs involving BTC.import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : 'YOUR_API_KEY'} response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) print(response.json())Here's the response for BTC exchange rate to various assets, e.g EUR, USD, ETH, XRP:{ ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""rates"": [  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""EUR"",   ""rate"": 26371.195622912368  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"",   ""rate"": 29222.332203558577  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""ETH"",   ""rate"": 15.780394091251145  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""XRP"",   ""rate"": 41915.164263881525  },  // ...more BTC exchange rates with various other assets...}To perform a cryptocurrency conversion from one currency to another, simply multiply the given amount by the exchange rate of the target cryptocurrency. Here's an example of converting 1.5 BTC to ETH:import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : ""YOUR_API_KEY""}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) #exchange rates with BTC as base assetrates = response.json()['rates'] # finding exchange rate for ETH (quote asset)eth_rate = [x['rate'] for x in rates if x['asset_id_quote'] == 'ETH'][0] btc_amount = 1.5eth_amount = btc_amount * eth_rate # actual conversionprint(f'1.5 BTC is equivalent to {eth_amount} ETH')Below is the result of 1.5 BTC to ETH conversion:>python convert.py1.5 BTC is equivalent to 23.671802476675076 ETHExchange rates endpoint plays a critical role in providing real-time conversion rates for cryptocurrencies. The rate represents the conversion factor that determines the value of one unit of the base currency in terms of the target currency. It indicates how much of the target currency you would get in exchange for one unit of the base currency.For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs Best Practices‚ÄãSecurity: never expose your API key publicly or commit it to version control. Store it in a secure and encrypted location and treat your API key as password.Error Handling: CoinAPI can return various error codes (like 400, 403, 429) indicating issues such as invalid input or rate limit exceeding. Make sure to handle these potential errors in your code.Rate Limiting: Ensure your application gracefully handles rate limit errors by implementing retry logic. Refer to CoinAPI's Rate Limiting documentation for more details.Error Handling‚ÄãInclude robust error handling to account for potential issues such as network errors, API limits, or invalid responses. Here's a simple example:try: response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() # Raises a HTTPError if the status is 4xx, 5xxexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f""An Error Occured: {err}"")else: data = response.json()Rate Limiting‚ÄãKeep track of your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits. CoinAPI provides different request tiers based on your subscription level.print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Used""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Limit""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Remaining""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Request-Cost""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Reset""))For more information about rate limiting check REST API Limits.API Key Security‚ÄãNever expose your API key in a client-side application or a public code repository. Always keep it securely on your server.dangerOnce your API key falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to make requests within your subscription.Caching‚ÄãTo minimize API calls and maximize efficiency, consider implementing caching on your end.Troubleshooting‚ÄãIf you encounter any issues while connecting to CoinAPI, make sure to:Verify that your API key is correct.Check if you have reached the API rate limit.Confirm that you're using the right endpoint and method (GET, POST, etc.).Ensure you've installed the correct libraries and dependencies and are using a supported version of the programming language.You're now ready to use CoinAPI's API to access cryptocurrency data efficiently and effectively.

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).Software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self Hosted - Software on our side, on your everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder-flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manage the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimize the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self Hosted, if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components‚ÄãAn self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consist of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component is exposing the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintainitng connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.CoinAPI EMS WebUI - Web interface (GUI) to the EMS API interface. (optional)Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features‚ÄãLow latency support‚ÄãSpecific projects usually involving High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, this components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application Closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction‚ÄãOur EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API to which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and assets standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry standard protocols‚ÄãOur API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud‚ÄãDeploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise let us manage the infrasturcture and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy‚ÄãDon't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports are never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi account support‚ÄãManage unlimited number exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages‚ÄãWe have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. Full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support‚ÄãLeverage support for all market types and order types.High quality integrations‚ÄãOur integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with the stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance‚ÄãEMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloading the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability‚ÄãThe EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring‚ÄãUsing the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle‚ÄãThis section will describe lifecycle of the order in the EMS sofware.Order status description‚ÄãThis table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force‚ÄãTime in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

More than one instruction can apply to an order. The table below describes how to interpret execution instructions parameter values. Legend: X - supported.InstructionShortcodeDescriptionAUCTION_ONLYAOAn Auction Only (AO) instructs exchange that this order is for the auction only book for the next auction. The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards.

As we establish the highest-ranking exchanges that have this data for each asset pair, we ensure that the highest quality data is used for each of them. The rank used for asset pairing is carried over to the following steps.Every 1 second, we update VWAP24 data for every asset pair across all data sources.For each asset pair, we also discard data that is outside the 3 sigma range if there are at least 3 exchanges for this asset pair.From the VWAP24 data, we are creating a tree structure where node/vertex = asset and edge = rate.By traversing the tree structure using the BFS algorithm and our secret sauce, we are able to establish the final exchange rates.üìÑÔ∏è Get all current ratesGet the current exchange rate between requested asset and all other assets.üìÑÔ∏è Timeseries dataGet the historical exchange rates between two assets in the form of the timeseries.üìÑÔ∏è Timeseries periodsYou can also obtain historical exchange rates of any asset pair, grouped into time periods.üìÑÔ∏è Get specific rateRetrieves the exchange rate for a specific base and quote asset at a given time or the current rate.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousREST APINext Get all current ratesCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio‚ÄãCoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is very handy for researchers that are not much familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers are able to access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate with each other. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?‚ÄãCoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real-time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can actually use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation.

We will explore using the WebSocket protocol in Python, JavaScript, and Java to get live market data updates.Understanding WebSocket Protocol‚ÄãCoinAPI provides real-time data through the WebSocket protocol. WebSocket allows for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making it an excellent choice for live data updates. The key endpoint for real-time data is wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/. To subscribe to a specific type of data, you need to send a subscription message after the connection is established.Python Example‚ÄãIn Python, we can use the websocket-client library to connect to CoinAPI's WebSocket API. If you don't have the websocket-client library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install websocket-clientHere's an example of real time trade data retrieval:import websocketimport json def on_message(ws, message): print(message) def on_error(ws, error): print(error) def on_close(ws): print(""### closed ###"") def on_open(ws): ws.send(json.dumps({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_USD$"" ] })) ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1"",        on_message = on_message,        on_error = on_error,        on_close = on_close)ws.on_open = on_openws.run_forever()This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesNote: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript Example‚ÄãMakes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""ws"": ""^8.13.0"" }}In JavaScript, you can use WebSocket API:import WebSocket from 'ws';const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/'); socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"" ] }));}; socket.onmessage = function (event) { console.log(event.data);}; socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesInstall dependencies via npm install command. Execute your program in nodejs runtime environment with node your-script-name.js command.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript in web browser‚ÄãHere's example which works directly in web browser, just create index.html file, paste code and start in web browser:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <title>Realtime Crypto Market Data Example</title></head><body> <script>  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };  socket.onmessage = function (event) {   console.log(event.data);   const contentDiv = document.getElementById('content');   contentDiv.textContent += event.data;  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  }; </script>  <div id=""content""> </body></html>Java Example‚ÄãIf you're using a Maven project, include Java-WebSocket and JSON dependencies in your pom.xml file:<dependencies> <dependency>  <groupId>org.java-websocket</groupId>  <artifactId>Java-WebSocket</artifactId>  <version>1.5.1</version> </dependency> <dependency>  <groupId>org.json</groupId>  <artifactId>json</artifactId>  <version>20210307</version> </dependency> </dependencies>Here's a Java example which uses WebSocketClient and JSONObject classes:import org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;import org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;import org.json.JSONArray;import org.json.JSONObject;import java.net.URI;import java.net.URISyntaxException;public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) {  try {   WebSocketClient socket = new WebSocketClient(new URI(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/"")) {        @Override    public void onOpen(ServerHandshake serverHandshake) {     JSONObject message = new JSONObject();     message.put(""type"", ""hello"");     message.put(""apikey"", ""YOUR_API_KEY"");     JSONArray subscribeDataType = new JSONArray();     subscribeDataType.put(""trade"");     message.put(""subscribe_data_type"", subscribeDataType);     JSONArray subscribeFilterSymbolId = new JSONArray();     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"");     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"");     message.put(""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"", subscribeFilterSymbolId);     this.send(message.toString());    }    @Override    public void onMessage(String message) {     System.out.println(message);    }    @Override    public void onClose(int code, String reason, boolean remote) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket closed"");    }    @Override    public void onError(Exception ex) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket error: "" + ex.getMessage());    }   };   socket.connect();  } catch (URISyntaxException e) {   e.printStackTrace();  } }}This Java program:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesBest Practices‚ÄãHandle connection issues: internet connections aren't always stable. Implement reconnection logic for robustness.Handle rate limiting: even for WebSocket connections, CoinAPI has rate limits. Keep track of your message rate.Secure your API Key: do not hardcode your API key. Make sure it is kept secure, consider using environment variables or secure config files which are not committed to your version control system.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.Troubleshooting‚ÄãIf you're having issues, double-check the following:The API key is correct and has the required permissions.The WebSocket endpoint URL is correctly formatted.The subscription message contains a valid symbol_id.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.Stay tuned for more tutorials on advanced uses of CoinAPI!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousReal-time data visualization with javascriptNextRetrieve and analyze crypto order book data using a cryptocurrency APIIntroductionUnderstanding WebSocket ProtocolPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJavaScript in web browserJava ExampleBest PracticesTroubleshootingCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

If filter symbols target more than one exchange, error is returned.infoWhen requesting current order book data limited to a single level, then quotes are actually used. This information is important from the perspective that quotes data could be faster than order book data (behavior is dependent solely one the data source) and they can have the size equal to 0 when the size is unknown. Some data sources publish order books and separately quote data (without the sizes) at a higher frequency. In that case, we will merge the order book feed with quotes feed to make sure that our updates are as fast as possible. The quotes will have the size equal to 0 as the value is unknown and the customer can decide if these higher frequency updates without the sizes are valuable or if not then can discard them or ask for at least 2 order book levels (in case of a REST API call).

Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?‚ÄãCoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission‚ÄãCoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio‚ÄãCoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is very handy for researchers that are not much familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers are able to access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate with each other. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?‚ÄãCoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real-time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can actually use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation. Clients can get all of their crypto APIs in one place, which makes it easier to manage large-scale crypto operations, trading, and data access.Still uncertain about how CoinAPI can help your business?

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General‚ÄãIf you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests‚ÄãEach HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success‚ÄãSuccessful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors‚ÄãError message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits‚ÄãAny authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn‚Äôt available, isn‚Äôt used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise ‚Äî if the limit query parameter is available and is used ‚Äî then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame. This header indicates the number of requests that can still be made within the allocated quota for the current 24-hour period.GET v1/exchanges/ECB/apiKey-ED802AF4-E855-YOUR-API-KEYHost: coinapi.ioX-RateLimit-Used: 1000X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001ZX-RateLimit-Quota-Overage: ENABLEDX-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000Explanation:X-RateLimit-Used: 1000 (requests used in the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000 (total request limit within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000 (requests remaining within the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1 (cost or ""weight"" of each individual request)X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001Z (when the rate limit will reset within a 24-hour period)X-RateLimit-Overage: ENABLED (API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000 (total number of requests allowed for all API keys within the subscription within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000 (requests remaining within the subscription's allocated quota within the last 24 hours)Concurrency limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum concurrent API calls/requests that the API could process for your subscription at the current moment.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:‚ÄãOpen the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel‚ÄãUse PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets‚ÄãUse =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc‚ÄãSelect the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

The key is needed to authenticate your application requests. Follow the instructions provided in CoinAPI's Getting Started Guide to set up your account.Setting Up Your React App‚ÄãBegin by creating a new React application. You can do this using the create-react-app command or your preferred method. npx create-react-app coinapi-portfolio-tracker-appYou should have then following project structure:Get into the root of the folder in which package.json resides and check whether project is compiling & starting:npm startOnce your app structure is ready and project successfully compiles, open the App.js file. Copy and paste the following code into the App.js to see header displaying ""CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App"".import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() { return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Start application again using npm start:Retrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPI‚ÄãCoinAPI provides the v1/exchangerate/asset_id_base endpoint for fetching the latest exchange rates of your assets. To request BTC/USD, ETH/USD and XRP/USD exchange rates from CoinAPI, we'll use useEffect hook and axios module to retrive data. This hook will fetch the exchange rates when the component mounts and then update the portfolio state. Add following code as part of the App.js:import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() {const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]);useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Note: Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with API key you have obtained via CoinAPI website.To make exchange rates appear in your web app, update the return part with following code:return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );Here's the complete App.js code:import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );}export default App;Before starting the application, make sure to install axios module via npm install axios command. Then start the application with npm start and check out the result:Styling Your Portfolio Tracker‚ÄãHaving fetched your portfolio data, you can now proceed to style your tracker. You can use raw CSS or opt for a UI library like Bootstrap or Material UI to enhance the look of your portfolio tracker. Here we'll use a css styling approach and following classes: portfolio, portfolio-item, asset-name and asset-rate. Extend GUI part with className attributes values as following: return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );then update index.css with css class implementation:.portfolio { padding: 1em;}.portfolio-item { display: flex; align-items: center; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;}.asset-name { font-weight: bold; margin-right: 10px; color: #007bff;}.asset-rate { color: #28a745;}.portfolio-item:hover { transform: scale(0.95); transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;}Retrieve data at regular intervals‚ÄãRather than repeatedly refreshing the application to obtain the most recent exchange rates, we can enhance it to fetch this data at specified intervals and automatically update the view. To update the exchange rates every 5 seconds, you can use the setInterval function in React.import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); // Fetch exchange rates every 5 seconds const intervalId = setInterval(fetchExchangeRates, 5000); // Clean up the interval when the component unmounts to avoid memory leaks return () => clearInterval(intervalId); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );}export default App;By following these steps, you'll create a basic cryptocurrency portfolio tracker using React and CoinAPI. For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs If you would like the data to be sent to you in real-time, check our Real-time data visualization with javascript or real-time trades stream using WebSocket with different languages how-to articles.Happy coding!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousAcquire exchange rates with different programming languagesNextCreating a historical crypto price chart using CoinAPI and D3.jsGetting Started with CoinAPISetting Up Your React AppRetrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPIStyling Your Portfolio TrackerRetrieve data at regular intervalsCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

CoinAPI is your one-stop solution for cryptocurrency data. We offer seamless access to real-time and historical financial data from hundreds of exchanges. Whether you're looking for raw trading data, OHLCV, or specific events, we've got you covered.We support multiple data delivery methods like REST, WebSocket, and more. Perfect for developers looking to build anything from trading algorithms to financial visualizations.Let's set it up üöÄ‚ÄãCoinAPI is your go-to platform for obtaining real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, featuring comprehensive API solutions suitable for developers and financial analysts alike. Coupled with D3.js, a javascript library for data visualization, you have the perfect toolkit for crafting sophisticated, real-time financial dashboards or trading algorithms. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to utilize CoinAPI's RESTful API in web environment to fetch cryptocurrency data. You'll also learn how to visualize data using D3.js.Getting Started‚ÄãFirst, create a new project folder on your computer and name it crypto_price_chart. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.Setting Up the API Request‚ÄãTo fetch data from CoinAPI, we'll first need to make an API request. This will require an API key, which you can obtain by registering at the CoinAPI website.Code Snippet: Prepare index.html‚ÄãHere's the basic structure of a web page designed to visualize cryptocurrency closing prices over a specified time period using D3.js.<!doctype html><html> <head> <title>Coinapi</title> <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js""></script> <script src=""script.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css""> </head> <h1>BTC Closing Prices Over Time</h1> <h3>(Data Period: 1 Day, Starting from January 1st, 2021, for 360 Days)</h3> <svg width=""800"" height=""600""></svg></html>Code Snippet: Fetching Data from CoinAPI‚ÄãCreate a function in your script.js to fetch historical data.const API_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"";const url = `https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?apikey=${API_KEY}&period_id=1DAY&time_start=2021-01-01T00:00:00&limit=360`;async function fetchData() { try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) {  throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); } const data = await response.json(); return data; } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching data:', error); throw error; }}Preparing the Data‚ÄãAfter fetching the data, it needs to be prepared for charting. We'll create a simple function to transform the data into a format that D3.js can easily interpret. Add it to the end of script.js.Code Snippet: Data Transformation‚Äãfunction transformData(data) { return data.map(entry => ({ date: new Date(entry.time_period_start), price: entry.price_close }));}Now let's dive into building the chart.Code Snippet: building chart with D3.js‚ÄãAdd this code at the end of your script.js file.document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { const svg = d3.select(""svg""); // Select the existing SVG element in the HTML fetchData() .then(data => {  const transformedData = transformData(data);  // Define chart dimensions  const width = 800;  const height = 600;  const margin = { top: 50, right: 50, bottom: 50, left: 50 };  // Create a group for the chart elements  const chartGroup = svg.append(""g"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(${margin.left}, ${margin.top})`);  // Create scales  const xScale = d3.scaleUtc()  .domain(d3.extent(transformedData, d => d.date))  .range([0, width - margin.left - margin.right]);  const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()  .domain([0, d3.max(transformedData, d => d.price)])  .range([height - margin.bottom - margin.top, 0]);  // Create a line generator  const line = d3.line()  .x(d => xScale(d.date))  .y(d => yScale(d.price));  // Draw the line  chartGroup.append(""path"")  .datum(transformedData)  .attr(""class"", ""line"")  .attr(""d"", line);  // Add axes  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""x-axis"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(0, ${height - margin.bottom - margin.top})`)  .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale));  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""y-axis"")  .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale)); }) .catch(error => console.log(error));});Code snippet: styling the chart‚ÄãNow, let's style your chart using the provided CSS. Add the following CSS to your style.css file:body, h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li { margin: 5; padding: 0; color: white;}/* Set a gradient background for the body */body { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #080059, #6C4CFC);}/* Style the SVG container */svg { background-color: transparent; /* Transparent background for the chart */}/* Style the chart line */.line { fill: none; stroke: #6C4CFC; /* Purple color for the line */ stroke-width: 2;}/* Style the x-axis */.x-axis path,.x-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for x-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.x-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the x-axis labels */}/* Style the y-axis */.y-axis path,.y-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for y-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.y-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the y-axis labels */}/* Style the legend */.legend { font-size: 16px; text-align: right; color: white; /* Text color for the legend text */}Testing Your Chart‚ÄãSave all your files and open index.html in a web browser.

This step is necessary as we need to discover the address of the EMS API component.""http_config"": { 	""response_headers"": { 	 ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"": ""*"" 	} }Installation Manual‚ÄãThis section will provide the necessary information how to install the CoinAPI EMS software.Service discovery‚ÄãThe CoinAPI EMS API is capable of automaticaly detecting all your instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge service. This service discovery works by the one of the following methods:Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud, every time you start CoinAPI EMS Edge, it will register automatically in our central cloud infrastructure.Using the HashiCorp Consul Cluster.Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud is a default, simple, and straightforward method. Only one disadvantage of using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud over Consul Cluster is that we do not measure the latencies if one order destination is registered more than one time in the cluster for failover scenarios. Then CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud will connect to the last started exchange; however, when using the Consul Cluster, it will connect to the order destination in the closest proximity data center to the datacenter where CoinAPI EMS API is run.Running using an executable‚ÄãTo install the precompiled binary, download the latest version of the executable matching your system architecture from http://coinapi-releases.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Our software is currently packaged as a zip file, and we currently do not plan to distribute it another way. Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The self-contained binary inside is necessary to run EMS, and any additional files are not required to run the software.If you intend to access it from the command-line, make sure to place the binary somewhere on your PATH. You may require to add the executable to the system startup with all necessary parameters if you want the software to be started automatically after restart.Running on Docker‚Äã# example using only command line parametersdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTC \ --OD:PublicApiKey _public_api_key_ --OD:PrivateApiKey _private_api_key_ \ --CoinAPI:ApiKey _coinapi_api_key_ docker run -d --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-webuidocker run --net=host coinapi/oeml-cli# example with enviroment variables filecat > oeml.env << EOFCoinAPI__ApiKey=_coinapi_api_key_OD__PublicApiKey=_public_api_key_OD__PrivateApiKey=_private_api_key_EOFdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTCdocker run -d --name=BITFINEX --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId BITFINEXdocker run -d --name=OEML_EDGE --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.envOur software is listed in public docker repository. To run the software on docker, use the following images:coinapi/oeml-apicoinapi/oeml-clicoinapi/oeml-webuiTo pass the configuration parameters using the environment variables (more information about this feature is available in the Configuration Manual section of this documentation), the environment variables must be provided into the container and not set on the host machine.It's a good practice to lock itself into the specific version. To do that you can supply the version after image name and : separator, e.g. coinapi/oeml-api:1.1255Running on Kubernetes Cluster‚ÄãOur software is compatible with Kubernetes, and you can quickly run it on the cluster using our (Helm Charts)[https://github.com/coinapi/helm-charts]. Follow steps below to perform quickstart deployment.Add the Repository to Helm‚Äã$ helm repo add coinapi-charts https://coinapi.github.io/helm-charts/$ helm repo updateHelm chart configuration‚ÄãThe example config below will create two api pods, a composite pod, and a webui pod.

If the lowest latency is required, start the instance per location or server where the API will is used to minimize latency between API client and the EMS API Server.(optional) Run the CoinAPI EMS WebUI to have GUI to the cluster.Done! All the exchange accounts can be managed using the single API.Installation‚ÄãCoinAPI EMS can be installed using several approaches:Running using an executableRunning on DockerRunning on Kubernetes ClusterOur software is compiled for the following architectures:linux-x64linux-arm64osx-x64osx-arm64win-x64 win-arm64Take a look at the Starter Guide of this documentation for more information how to run the software in the specific conditions.If you can't use any of those, let us know why that is a problem by creating a support case, and we will evaluate the possibility of extending compatibility.Upgrading‚ÄãCurrently, all components are stateless. Upgrading stateless components is limited to replacing the binaries or running the new docker image.Versioning & Compatibility‚ÄãOur software is versioned using the Major.Minor(+branch) pattern. Major version number is incremented manually on our side, and its scope is for the EMS project. The Minor version number is incremented on every release automatically separately for every component.You can assume that our software components will work together when their Major version numbers are the same.Time synchronization‚ÄãEMS highly depends on the current time to perform actions and correctly timestamp the data for real-time trading, risk management, compliance, or reporting.For the time synchronization we strongly recommending:chrony (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, macOS)w32tm (Windows)If you can't use any of the programs above for reasons like:Software has not been ported to my operating system.Software doesn't have a driver or it's not compatible with my hardware reference clock, and I can't use other programs like gpsd or ntp-refclock to provide reference time via the SHM or SOCK interface.Then it's worth trying solutions below (ordered from the best to worst options):ntp (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows)openntpd (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS)If need the sub-millisecond or sub-nanosecond accuracy take a look there:Meinberg Radio ClocksWhite RabbitLimits‚ÄãThis section will list all known software limitations.Limit descriptionLimit valueMaximum number of managed exchange accounts in a single clusterUnlimitedMaximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster host when running an executable65,535Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Docker or Docker Swarm1024Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Kubernetes250Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)from 4 to 737Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)100Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)250tipThere is no limit of exchange accounts that can simultaneously be managed using our EMS API.Integrations & Plugins‚ÄãThis section is reserved for Integrations, plugins or other external tools or modules that make it easier to work with EMS API.Prometheus metrics‚ÄãIn this section, we will describe the metrics exposed by the software on the /metrics endpoint.

CoinAPI offers extensive historical data across multiple cryptocurrency markets, which is critical for backtesting trading strategies, performing quantitative research, or even for creating visualizations. We will cover how to interact with our historical data endpoints using Python, JavaScript and Java.Understanding CoinAPI Endpoints‚ÄãCoinAPI provides several endpoints for accessing historical data, including:ohlcv/period_id/history: Provides historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for specified periods.trades/symbol_id/history: Returns historical trades.quotes/symbol_id/history: Provides historical quotes.Remember, you need to replace period_Id and symbol_id with your desired period and symbol respectively.Python Example‚ÄãUsing Python, we can use the requests library to interact with CoinAPI. If you don't have the requests library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example:import requestsdef fetch_ohlcv(): url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"" headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" } # Replace with your API key response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) # Check if the response is successful if response.status_code == 200:  if response.content:   return response.json()  else:   print(""Response is empty."")   return None else:  # Handle other HTTP status codes  print(f""Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}"")  return None print(fetch_ohlcv())This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.JavaScript Example‚ÄãMakes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. In JavaScript, we can use the fetch API for sending requests to CoinAPI:First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Add following code and run npm install to install dependencies.import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00', { headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Java Example‚ÄãIn Java, we can use the HttpURLConnection class to send HTTP requests:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Best Practices‚ÄãStore API keys securely: never hard-code API keys. Instead, store them in secure configuration files or environment variables.Handle rate limiting: be aware of CoinAPI's rate limits and handle 429 HTTP status codes gracefully in your application.Efficient data fetching: use query parameters like time_start and limit effectively to get the data you need without excess.Troubleshooting‚ÄãIn case you face any issues, ensure the following:Your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.You are not exceeding the rate limit for your account type.You are using the correct endpoint with proper request headers.The symbol and period IDs you are using are valid and in the correct format.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.For more information, you can check REST API OHLVC docsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousFetching market data with KNIMENextGet symbol funding rate metric data using CoinAPIIntroductionUnderstanding CoinAPI EndpointsPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJava ExampleCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

EMS - Starter Guide | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APISelf Hosted GuideREST APIWebSocket APIFIX APIEMS - Managed Cloud REST APIEMS APIOn this pageEMS - Starter GuideThis section will provide general information about the Execution Management System API (EMS API) software product and enumerate a number of features that it provides.infoThe key words ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.What is EMS API?‚ÄãExecution Management System (EMS) is a software that managing orders, executions and exposure in an efficient, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward manner. An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).Software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self Hosted - Software on our side, on your everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder-flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manage the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimize the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self Hosted, if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components‚ÄãAn self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consist of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component is exposing the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintainitng connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.CoinAPI EMS WebUI - Web interface (GUI) to the EMS API interface. (optional)Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features‚ÄãLow latency support‚ÄãSpecific projects usually involving High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, this components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application Closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction‚ÄãOur EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API to which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and assets standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry standard protocols‚ÄãOur API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud‚ÄãDeploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise let us manage the infrasturcture and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy‚ÄãDon't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports are never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi account support‚ÄãManage unlimited number exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages‚ÄãWe have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. Full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support‚ÄãLeverage support for all market types and order types.High quality integrations‚ÄãOur integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with the stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance‚ÄãEMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloading the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability‚ÄãThe EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring‚ÄãUsing the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle‚ÄãThis section will describe lifecycle of the order in the EMS sofware.Order status description‚ÄãThis table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force‚ÄãTime in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General‚ÄãIf you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests‚ÄãEach HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success‚ÄãSuccessful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors‚ÄãError message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits‚ÄãAny authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn‚Äôt available, isn‚Äôt used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise ‚Äî if the limit query parameter is available and is used ‚Äî then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:‚ÄãOpen the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel‚ÄãUse PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets‚ÄãUse =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc‚ÄãSelect the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

Authentication | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIAuthenticationOn this pageAuthenticationIn this section, you will find comprehensive information about the process of coinapi authentication. It covers the fundamental aspects and procedures involved in obtaining authentication for coinapi usage. Whether you are new to coinapi or seeking to enhance your understanding of the authentication process, this section will provide you with a valuable overview of the topic.There are different types of authentication methods available to secure and control access to its services.API Key - fundamental method of authentication that involves the usage of an API key for authentication and access control.API Key + JWT token - extended authentication method that combines the use of an API key along with a JWT token for enhanced security and authentication. Useful when you need to share the API Key publicly, for example when accessing the CoinAPI endpoints from the frontend JavaScript code exposed to the end-users. JWT token will be required along the API Key from the CoinAPI side to perform successful authentication, and the JWT tokens can be only generated from your side as you know the secret (private key or secret) based on which JWT token with the specified expiration time are issued.Authentication methods supported by the API‚ÄãHere's an overview of the various products offered by coinapi and the supported authentication methods for each product. To use resources that require authorized access, you will need to use one of the many authenitcation methods described below.Product nameAPIX-CoinAPI-Key headerQuery paramURL pathAuthorization headerBasic authJWTTLS Client CertSenderCompIDAWS Signature Version 2/4Market DataREST‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåMarket DataWS‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåMarket DataFIX‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚úÖ‚ùåMarket DataS3‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚úÖEMSManaged Cloud REST‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåEMSREST‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùåEMSWS‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚úÖ‚ùå‚ùåEMSFIX‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùåcautionIf you are using the Authorization header to pass the API key, please note that it cannot be used together with a JWT token. In case you have enabled JWT authentication, we recommend using alternative methods to pass API key such as: Custom authentication header, Query string parameter or API Key in URL.X-CoinAPI-Key header‚ÄãYou can authorize by providing additional custom header named X-CoinAPI-Key and API key as its value.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, then the authentication header you should send to us will look like:X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYQuery string parameter (apikey)‚ÄãYou can authorize by providing an additional parameter named apikey with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY and that you want to request all exchange rates from BTC asset, then your query string should look like this: GET /v1/exchangerate/BTC?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYcautionQuery string method may be more practical for development activities.URL path‚ÄãTo ensure proper authentication when passing the API key in the URL, it is important to format it correctly. The real API key should always be preceded by the APIKEY- prefix, followed by the actual API key. For example, if your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, the URL should be structured as /APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY.The API key can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of the URL path. Note that the key is completely ignored when determining the path of the requested resource. Here are examples of the different placements:At the beginning of the URL:/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/v1/exchangesIn the middle of the URL:/v1/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/exchangesAt the end of the URL:/v1/exchanges/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYPlease make sure to replace 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY with your actual API key for authentication and access to the requested resources and remember to include the APIKEY- prefix before your real API key.Authorization header‚ÄãThis method involves including the API key directly in the Authorization header of the API request.Authorization: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYBasic auth‚ÄãUse Basic Authentication by setting the Authorization header with a base64 encoded string that combines your API key with a username (coinapi):Authorization: Basic Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk=In this example, Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk is a base64 encoded string of the username and API key (coinapi:73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY).JWT token‚ÄãThe JWT authentication method provides a secure and efficient way to authorize requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). With this method, JWTs can be passed via the Authorization header in the Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Supported JWT Algorithms‚ÄãJWT authentication method supports the following algorithms for JWT token verification with various key sizes:RSASSA-PSS (e.g. PS256)RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g. RS256)ECDSA (e.g. ES256)HMAC (e.g. HS256)Enabling JWT authentication‚ÄãTo enable JWT authentication for your API key:Access the customer portal and import public JWT key (RSA or ECDSA) for API key.Generate JWT token using your private key (it ensures authenticity and integrity of the token)Include the generated JWT token in Authorization header of your api requests using Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Let CoinAPI server verify the token's authenticity using the corresponding public key you've imported in step 1 during API request.Example request with JWT authentication‚ÄãTo include a JWT in an API request, add the token to the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The format of the header is as follows: `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN`Example request header with JWT token generated using RS256 algorithm:Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5ODViMmQ0ZC1kMjE1LTQwN2MtODcxNi01NTIzNjA0YmM0ZTIiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.ew0KICAic3ViIjogIjEyMzQ1Njc4OTAiLA0KICAibmFtZSI6ICJFWEFNUExFIFRPS0VOIiwNCiAgImlhdCI6IDE1MTYyMzkwMjIsDQogICJuYmYiOiAxNjg2MTM3MDI0LA0KICAiZXhwIjogMTcxNzY3MzAyNA0KfQ.CX6MWRSXQPKuQ_jrFCME91IwZhK8lq_2XrbDOyZ4-tPo0Ro52HA289sIfLo2LNafWQlq2lClfCN55TxyfC8n0xiifUwdec7g3kcGjCri6vTxaa8p6S3Fyyt2DxXccpi3Se4d_3mEQBZwMchKbQsw-W7Wj7njUk31ycgPQovvF4WrTuEYmhYw1sO9jCTORHmsSO7Shml7kv7AxlIUmzB2oq2KSmBhJV38Nz9oYj3KlPoMjgaIl4xYldNqnGyshh6fQyUQ1gQMQV6e4M5ro8YthjPOCvAT8yk77dTyOoE6Im58cAp6KtM-Gko-tWppUQTu-0M82LOvD_duP77n-hcoTwDecoded JWT token header:{ ""kid"": ""985b2d4d-d215-407c-8716-5523604bc4e2"", ""alg"": ""RS256"" }Decoded JWT token payload:{ ""sub"": ""1234567890"", ""name"": ""EXAMPLE TOKEN"", ""iat"": 1516239022, ""nbf"": 1686137024, ""exp"": 1717673024}JWT Token expiration‚ÄãTo ensure the validity of JWT tokens and prevent the use of expired tokens, the inclusion of the following claims is required:NBF (Not Before)The ""nbf"" claim specifies the earliest time at which the token can be considered valid. Tokens with a ""nbf"" claim set in the future should not be accepted.EXP (Expiration Time)The ""exp"" claim defines the expiration time of the token. Tokens with an ""exp"" claim set in the past should not be accepted.Request authentication‚ÄãDuring the process of request authentication, the coinapi server follows a series of steps to ensure secure access to its resources. Here's an overview of the authentication process:Upon receiving the request, the coinapi server extracts the JWT from Authorization header.Then, it verifies JWT signature and checks the ""NBF"" and ""EXP"" claims to ensure token validity and expiration.If the JWT is valid and not expired, the server authorizes the request and proceeds with the necessary processing to access coinapi resources.If the JWT is invalid or expired, the server returns an appropriate error response.TLS Client Cert‚ÄãTLS Client Certificate acquired from the Managed Cloud REST API (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) provided while establishing a TLS session with us.SenderCompID‚ÄãThis method of authentication is FIX protocol specific. Exact message that needs to be sent to us will be described in the documentation of the specific API protocol Logon (35=A) message page.AWS Signature Version 2‚ÄãPlease in this method of authorization put the API Key in the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key fields.AWS Signature Version 4‚ÄãAMAZON S3 uses Authorization request header to provide authorization information. The value for this header must follow spcific pattern described as AWS Signature Version 4.Example below shows Authorization header value compliant with AWS Signature Version 4.Please note that Credential string contains our apikey as access-key-id. Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like:Authentication: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/20211203/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host; Signature=65e655c69da9906ac6076a28f75d9e4947aaed3be1f419757a3a84e24662673dAlthough AWS Signature Version 4 is very strict about each of the signature components, our API takes only our apikey value into account.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousWelcomeNextHow-to guidesAuthentication methods supported by the APIX-CoinAPI-Key headerQuery string parameter (apikey)URL pathAuthorization headerBasic authJWT tokenTLS Client CertSenderCompIDAWS Signature Version 2AWS Signature Version 4Copyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We'll use Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for data visualization.Prerequisites‚ÄãBasic understanding of JavaScript and WebSockets.A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website).Familiarity with Chart.js (Visit the Chart.js documentation for more information).Visualizing Data with Chart.js‚ÄãFirst, we'll create an empty chart using Chart.js. <!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we'll establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/ </script></body></html>The script creates a new line chart with an empty dataset. We'll fill in the data as we receive it from the WebSocket connection in next step.Setting Up the WebSocket Connection‚ÄãWe need to set up a WebSocket connection to CoinAPI and update chart: /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""] }));};socket.onmessage = function (event) {    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);    // Add new data to the chart  chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);  chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);    // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50  if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {   chart.data.labels.shift();   chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();  }    // Update the chart  chart.update();};socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Here's the complete code:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };    socket.onmessage = function (event) {        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);        // Add new data to the chart    chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);    chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);        // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50    if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {     chart.data.labels.shift();     chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();    }        // Update the chart    chart.update();  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  };   </script></body></html>The onmessage event is activated whenever a new message (in our case, trade data) is received from the server. The message data is in JSON format, which we convert to a JavaScript object with JSON.parse().Our chart now updates in real-time as we receive trade data from CoinAPI!You're now equipped to use CoinAPI with JavaScript for real-time data visualization. Dive into the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies and explore with these powerful tools at your disposal.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General‚ÄãIf you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests‚ÄãEach HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success‚ÄãSuccessful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors‚ÄãError message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits‚ÄãAny authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn‚Äôt available, isn‚Äôt used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise ‚Äî if the limit query parameter is available and is used ‚Äî then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame. This header indicates the number of requests that can still be made within the allocated quota for the current 24-hour period.GET v1/exchanges/ECB/apiKey-ED802AF4-E855-YOUR-API-KEYHost: coinapi.ioX-RateLimit-Used: 1000X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001ZX-RateLimit-Quota-Overage: ENABLEDX-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000Explanation:X-RateLimit-Used: 1000 (requests used in the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000 (total request limit within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000 (requests remaining within the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1 (cost or ""weight"" of each individual request)X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001Z (when the rate limit will reset within a 24-hour period)X-RateLimit-Overage: ENABLED (API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000 (total number of requests allowed for all API keys within the subscription within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000 (requests remaining within the subscription's allocated quota within the last 24 hours)Concurrency limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum concurrent API calls/requests that the API could process for your subscription at the current moment.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:‚ÄãOpen the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel‚ÄãUse PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets‚ÄãUse =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc‚ÄãSelect the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

(exist only in case of the error)Concurrency limit / APIKey‚ÄãX-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum allowed concurrent websocket connections per APIKey at the current moment. Every new WebSocket connection increases the Concurrency limit against quota, and when it's closed, decreases it.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-ConcurrencyLimit-LimitintConcurrency limit allocated for your API key.X-ConcurrencyLimit-RemainingintThe number of concurrent WebSocket connections available to be established in this moment for your API key.Data buffering‚ÄãData buffering JSON error message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""error"", ""message"": ""Reached maximum allowed buffered messages for this connection.""}The stream will send the data to the client as fast as possible; this can result in a high volume of data in cases where the subscription scope is broad. If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright ¬© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
