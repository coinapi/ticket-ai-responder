After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"":""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"":""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"", }Was this section helpful?12345PreviousHow to use CoinAPI from Matlab?NextWhat are the restrictions on usage of real-time protocols?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

3,i.io ,"i.io .   Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQChangelogWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?​CoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission​CoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio​CoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is handy for researchers who are not very familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers can access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?​CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don’t need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create a virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data.

CoinAPI offers easy access to a wide range of financial information, encompassing both live and historical data from various exchanges. Whether you’re looking for detailed trading data, OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), or specific event information, CoinAPI delivers. CoinAPI provides crypto order book data, making it one of the best crypto APIs available. Additionally, our support for multiple data delivery methods, including REST and WebSocket, makes it highly versatile for developers creating trading algorithms or crypto market data visualizations.Let's Begin 🚀​Harnessing the capabilities of CoinAPI, a robust cryptocurrency API, alongside Python, known for its versatility in data analysis and statistical computing, we can delve deeply into the nuances of the cryptocurrency market.We’ll walk you through the steps to fetch and analyze crypto order book data in real-time, leveraging the comprehensive data provided by the cryptocurrency API.Setting Up the API Request​To fetch real-time order book data, you'll first need an API key from CoinAPI website. Once you have it, you can proceed to retrieve the data using Python.Fetching the dataimport requestsimport jsonAPI_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE""url = f""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/orderbooks/current?symbol=KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD&apikey={API_KEY}""response = requests.get(url)if response.status_code == 200: # The request was successful data = response.json()  # Save the data to a file with open(""order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"", ""w"") as file:  json.dump(data, file, indent=4) print(""Data saved to order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"")else: # Handle error cases print(f""Error: Status code {response.status_code}"") print(response.text)Response{ ""symbol_id"": ""KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD"", ""time_exchange"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""time_coinapi"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""asks"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.1,   ""size"": 19.23618731  },  {   ""price"": 37549.9,   ""size"": 0.08242079  },  /// other entries omitted for brevity ], ""bids"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.0,   ""size"": 0.136004  },  {   ""price"": 37545.1,  }  /// other entries omitted for brevity ]}Data Analysis and Metrics​Upon data retrieval, the next step involves data analysis using Python. The obtained data typically represents a snapshot of buy and sell orders in the market at a specific moment. This data consists of two key components: bids and asks. Bids signify the price levels at which buyers are willing to acquire an asset, while asks represent the price levels at which sellers are willing to sell it. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is referred to as the spread.Here is a comprehensive list of common metrics and analytical procedures:Order Book Depth - visualize the liquidity available at various price levels.Order Imbalance - analyze the disparity between bids and asks to gain insights into market sentiment.Price Levels - identify significant price levels characterized by substantial volumes of bids or asks.Market Spread - compute the current bid-ask spread as an indicator of market liquidity.Order Book Depth Visualization​In this Python code, we demonstrate how to visualize the order book depth of a cryptocurrency trading pair using Matplotlib.import jsonimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to visualize order book depth chartdef visualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  bid_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in bids] bid_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in bids]  ask_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in asks] ask_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in asks]  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(bid_prices, bid_sizes, label=""Bids (buyers)"", color=""green"") plt.plot(ask_prices, ask_sizes, label=""Asks (sellers)"", color=""red"") plt.xlabel(""Price"") plt.ylabel(""Size"") plt.title(""Order Book Depth"") plt.legend() plt.show()# Visualize the order book depthvisualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data)The following visualization is the result of the Python script demonstrated above.Order Book Depth Visualization:is a measure of the quantity of buy and sell orders available for a particular financial assetit provides insight into market liquidity and the willingness of traders to buy or sell at different pricesmay be used for trading decisions, as it reveals potential price trendsOrder Imbalance, Price Levels, Market Spread​In this Python code, we explore order imbalance, significant bids & asks, market spread metrics for a BTC/USD trading pair.import json# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to calculate order imbalancedef calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data): bids = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""bids""]) asks = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""asks""]) order_imbalance = (bids - asks) / (bids + asks) return order_imbalance# Function to identify significant price levelsdef identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, threshold=50): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  significant_bids = [entry for entry in bids if entry[""size""] > threshold] significant_asks = [entry for entry in asks if entry[""size""] > threshold] return significant_bids, significant_asks# Function to calculate market spreaddef calculate_market_spread(order_book_data): best_bid = order_book_data[""bids""][0][""price""] best_ask = order_book_data[""asks""][0][""price""]  spread = best_ask - best_bid return spread# Common metrics calculationorder_imbalance = calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data)significant_price_threshold = 20significant_bids, significant_asks = identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, significant_price_threshold)spread = calculate_market_spread(order_book_data)print(""******************************"")print(""Order Imbalance:"", order_imbalance)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Bids:"", significant_bids)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Asks:"", significant_asks)print(""***************************"")print(""Market Spread:"", spread)print(""***************************"")Result> ******************************> Order Imbalance: -0.012400502029283922> ***************************> Significant Bids: [{'price': 37440.7, 'size': 24.73909889}, {'price': 36451.0, 'size': 25.0}]> ***************************> Significant Asks: [{'price': 37749.0, 'size': 25.0}, {'price': 37840.0, 'size': 24.08119208}, {'price': 38000.0, 'size': 29.60579175}, {'price': 39000.0, 'size': 21.75395535}, {'price': 40000.0, 'size': 58.28620718}]> ***************************> Market Spread: 0.09999999999854481> ***************************Calculated metrics:order_imbalance - it measures the difference between the total volume of buy orders and sell orders. It provides insights into the overall market sentiment by indicating whether there is an excess of buying or selling interest.significant_price_threshold is a predetermined value (set to 20 in this case) used to identify price levels in the order book that are considered significant. It helps traders focus on specific price points that may have a more substantial impact on the market.significant_bids and significant_asks are lists of price levels derived from the order book data that meet or exceed the significant_price_threshold. These levels are typically associated with higher trading activity and may be seen as key support and resistance levels.spread is a metric that calculates the difference between the best bid and best ask prices. It represents the cost of executing a market order and is a fundamental factor for traders to consider when entering or exiting positions.Summary​This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge and tools necessary to fetch and analyze cryptocurrency order book data using CoinAPI and Python. You've learned how to access real-time order book information, visualize order book depth and calculate important metrics. Armed with this understanding, you are now better prepared to explore and navigate the cryptocurrency markets, enabling you to make more informed trading decisions and develop data-driven trading strategies.

Bandwidth bottleneck2. Lack of the separation between the receiving thread and parsing, processing operations3. No CPU affinity on the receiving thread4. CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread5. Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack6. Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressureIf your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above then these things will happen:1. Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to you2. Our TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more data3. We will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)4. We will start dropping the messagesMore information is available by googling ""TCP Flow Control"".Was this section helpful?12345PreviousHow do I enable overage?NextI forgot my paid subscription API keyCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

This document should contain all the information required to properly implement applications using our API.3 main interfaces can be used to access CoinAPI:APICommunicationDescriptionRESTfulRequest-responseStateless API provides the widest range of data, not capable of streaming, only pooling.WebSocketPublish-subscribeStateful API providing streaming of real-time market data.FIXPublish-subscribeStateful API providing streaming of real-time market data, widely adopted by the finance industry.SDK​Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk. If possible then we are strongly recommending using our tested libraries available on GitHub, rather than creating new ones. However, if you decide to create your implementation or to change the existing one, then we encourage you to create a Pull Request to our main repository with the proposed changes, we will able to include your code in our official repository for use by other users, effectively creating collaboration.In the repository, you can find libraries or examples for languages or environments like:PythonRMatlabC#C++.NETJavaRubyGoJavaScriptTypeScriptNode.jsPHPHaskellObjective-CSwiftSecurity​The use of encryption is optional, and the decision to use it is on you. On the encrypted endpoints, we are using protocols that are considered the best security practices.tipYou should assume that we are always providing certificates signed by the Trusted Certification Authority.Standards and conventions​This section represents used standards and conventions across all documents and API's.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.Variables naming​All variables are named using the Snake case (or snake_case) naming convention. This means that words are separated by a single underscore _ character, no spaces are used, and letters are lowercase.Asset codes​ISO 4217 currency code standard is used for fiat money identifications. Cryptocurrency assets are identified using codes used by the general public or adopted by the majority of exchanges.Exchange codes​Exchange on our platform is identified by the specific exchange API and the matching engine behind it. When the example exchange has multiple separate APIs, e.g., for different products SPOT, OPTIONS, or to cover other regions, we will expose these symbols from these respective APIs on different exchange identifiers. Below are examples of BINANCE (multiple APIs, multiple regions) and DERIBIT (single API, single region).

In the Customer Portal, navigate to Subscriptions > APIKEYS > CREATE APIKEY It is important to note that the existence of each additional API Key for a subscription (enabled or disabled) above the plan quota is charged 1 USD per day, with a minimum of one dayThe multiple API keys can be limited via the configuration of the specific API key, for example, the specific API key newly created cannot overage or limit the specific API key to X number of requests to avoid causing issues for other keys. Increased security is one of the main benefits of having numerous API keys. Each key acts as an access point and particular identifier. Users can compartmentalize their access by making unique keys, which lowers the likelihood that a security breach will have a negative effect. The remaining keys are unaffected if one key is hacked, protecting sensitive information and reducing risks.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousGeneralNextHow do I enable overage?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

""BTC/USD 1 / (USDC/USD) = BTC/USD USD/USDC = BTC/USDC""Reconnect IN​Reconnect message is sent by the server to all connected clients when the server will be restarted or shut down at the defined exact time included in the message content. After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"": ""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"",}Message variables​VariableDescriptiontypeMessage type, always reconnectwithin_secondsSeconds within which reconnection should be performed.before_timeTime before which reconnection should be performed.Heartbeat IN​Heartbeat message JSON is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""hearbeat""}Heartbeat message is sent to you every time there is one second of silence in communication between us, if you agreed on this feature in Hello message.tipWebSocket working on TCP protocol which doesn’t have the feature indicating that the connection is broken without trying exchange data over it. As you will not be actively sending messages to us, with Heartbeat you can distinguish a situation where there are no market data updates for you (Heartbeat is delivered but no market data updates) or connection between us is broken (Heartbeat and market data updates are not delivered).

This tutorial walks you through the process of using CoinAPI's API to access exchange rates data using Python, Javascript and Java. The objective here is to equip you with the necessary know-how to utilize our API for your crypto projects.Prerequisites​A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)A basic understanding of at least one programming language: Python, Javascript or JavaAPI Key generation​Before we dive into code, it's crucial to understand that to use the CoinAPI, you need an API key. This key identifies your application and authorizes requests.Visit the CoinAPI websiteRegister an account or login if you already have oneNavigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API keyRemember to store your key safely - it's your credential!Making an API Request with Python​To connect to CoinAPI in Python, we'll use the requests library. If you don't have the 'requests' library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example of access-coinapi-data.py python script:import requestsdef fetch_data():url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD""headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR-API-KEY"" # Replace with your API key}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)return response.json()print(fetch_data())This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. To execute script, run python access-coinapi-data.py command.> python access-coinapi-data.py{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Javascript​Makes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. Add package.json with node-fetch module dependency.{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Create file access-coinapi-data.js with following code:import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD', {headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This example fetches the current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Install dependencies via npm install command. Execute your program in nodejs runtime environment with node access-coinapi-data.js command.> node access-coinapi-data.js{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Java​Make sure to install Java Development Kit (JDK) as it includes runtime environment (JRE) plus additional tools and utilities required for Java development. To check whether JRE and JDK are already installed on your system you may use java -version command.Java offers multiple ways to send HTTP requests. Here we'll use the HttpURLConnection class. Create Main.java file with following content:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. Use javac Main.java command to compile java source file into bytecode. Resulting bytecode file will be named Main.class. After the compilation step, you can execute the program using java Main to see the exchange rate output.> javac Main.Java> java Main{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Understanding the Response​CoinAPI returns data in JSON format, which we convert to a Python dictionary using response.json(). The /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint response includes:time: The timestamp of the last data update.asset_id_base: The base asset (in our case, BTC).asset_id_quote: The quote asset (in our case, USD).rate: The current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Converting Between Cryptocurrencies​The /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint retrieves the current exchange rate of BTC to USD. Additionally, the Exchange Rates endpoint provides the flexibility to obtain exchange rates between BTC and various other assets, allowing users to access the conversion rates for multiple asset pairs involving BTC.import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : 'YOUR_API_KEY'} response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) print(response.json())Here's the response for BTC exchange rate to various assets, e.g EUR, USD, ETH, XRP:{ ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""rates"": [  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""EUR"",   ""rate"": 26371.195622912368  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"",   ""rate"": 29222.332203558577  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""ETH"",   ""rate"": 15.780394091251145  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""XRP"",   ""rate"": 41915.164263881525  },  // ...more BTC exchange rates with various other assets...}To perform a cryptocurrency conversion from one currency to another, simply multiply the given amount by the exchange rate of the target cryptocurrency. Here's an example of converting 1.5 BTC to ETH:import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : ""YOUR_API_KEY""}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) #exchange rates with BTC as base assetrates = response.json()['rates'] # finding exchange rate for ETH (quote asset)eth_rate = [x['rate'] for x in rates if x['asset_id_quote'] == 'ETH'][0] btc_amount = 1.5eth_amount = btc_amount * eth_rate # actual conversionprint(f'1.5 BTC is equivalent to {eth_amount} ETH')Below is the result of 1.5 BTC to ETH conversion:>python convert.py1.5 BTC is equivalent to 23.671802476675076 ETHExchange rates endpoint plays a critical role in providing real-time conversion rates for cryptocurrencies. The rate represents the conversion factor that determines the value of one unit of the base currency in terms of the target currency. It indicates how much of the target currency you would get in exchange for one unit of the base currency.For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs Best Practices​Security: never expose your API key publicly or commit it to version control. Store it in a secure and encrypted location and treat your API key as password.Error Handling: CoinAPI can return various error codes (like 400, 403, 429) indicating issues such as invalid input or rate limit exceeding. Make sure to handle these potential errors in your code.Rate Limiting: Ensure your application gracefully handles rate limit errors by implementing retry logic. Refer to CoinAPI's Rate Limiting documentation for more details.Error Handling​Include robust error handling to account for potential issues such as network errors, API limits, or invalid responses. Here's a simple example:try: response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() # Raises a HTTPError if the status is 4xx, 5xxexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f""An Error Occured: {err}"")else: data = response.json()Rate Limiting​Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits. CoinAPI provides different request tiers based on your subscription level.print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Used""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Limit""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Remaining""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Request-Cost""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Reset""))For more information about rate limiting check REST API Limits.API Key Security​Never expose your API key in a client-side application or a public code repository. Always keep it securely on your server.dangerOnce your API key falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to make requests within your subscription.Caching​To minimize API calls and maximize efficiency, consider implementing caching on your end.Troubleshooting​If you encounter any issues while connecting to CoinAPI, make sure to:Verify that your API key is correct.Check if you have reached the API rate limit.Confirm that you're using the right endpoint and method (GET, POST, etc.).Ensure you've installed the correct libraries and dependencies and are using a supported version of the programming language.You're now ready to use CoinAPI's API to access cryptocurrency data efficiently and effectively.

EMS - Starter Guide | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APISelf Hosted GuideREST APIWebSocket APIFIX APIEMS - Managed Cloud REST APIFAQChangelogEMS APIOn this pageEMS - Starter GuideThis section will provide general information about the Execution Management System API (EMS API) software product and enumerate a number of features that it provides.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.What is EMS API?​Execution Management System (EMS) is a software that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward manner. An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards.

If possible then we are strongly recommending using our tested libraries available on GitHub, rather than creating new ones. However, if you decide to create your implementation or to change the existing one, then we encourage you to create a Pull Request to our main repository with the proposed changes, we will able to include your code in our official repository for use by other users, effectively creating collaboration.In the repository, you can find libraries or examples for languages or environments like:PythonRMatlabC#C++.NETJavaRubyGoJavaScriptTypeScriptNode.jsPHPHaskellObjective-CSwiftSecurity​The use of encryption is optional, and the decision to use it is on you. On the encrypted endpoints, we are using protocols that are considered the best security practices.tipYou should assume that we are always providing certificates signed by the Trusted Certification Authority.Standards and conventions​This section represents used standards and conventions across all documents and API's.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.Variables naming​All variables are named using the Snake case (or snake_case) naming convention. This means that words are separated by a single underscore _ character, no spaces are used, and letters are lowercase.Asset codes​ISO 4217 currency code standard is used for fiat money identifications. Cryptocurrency assets are identified using codes used by the general public or adopted by the majority of exchanges.Exchange codes​Exchange on our platform is identified by the specific exchange API and the matching engine behind it. When the example exchange has multiple separate APIs, e.g., for different products SPOT, OPTIONS, or to cover other regions, we will expose these symbols from these respective APIs on different exchange identifiers. Below are examples of BINANCE (multiple APIs, multiple regions) and DERIBIT (single API, single region).

We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request. For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).API calls are not equivalent to requests. To give an example, for the date 2023-01-01, you only made 85 API calls, but made a total of 10,012 requests. This is because some API calls pull more data, and every 100 of those data points are considered as 1 request. If you are under the Streamer subscription, you would be exceeding your subscription tier's daily request limit (10k daily requests) and get a 429 error (i.e too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits).How do I calculate the number of requests I'll be making for a certain query?​The limit query parameter defines the amount of items to return. If you are not using the limit query parameter, the default value will be 100. If you do use it, then every 100 output items will be counted as 1 request. For example, a request using the limit parameter with a value of 1,500 would cost 15 requests (1500/100=15).https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT/history?limit=1500&period_id=1MIN&time_start=2021-01-28&time_end=2022-01-28The minimum value for the limit parameter is 1 and the maximum is 100,000. In addition, you can check the number of requests used to generate the current HTTP response by checking your response header's x-ratelimit-request-cost. You can also check x-concurrencylimit-remaining to see your remaining requests for the day, and x-ratelimit-reset for the time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed. You can also check your REST API historical daily number of requests metrics by using our Customer Portal available at https://customerportal.coinapi.io/To learn more about REST API Limits, see here: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#limitsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousI forgot my paid subscription API keyNextWe need a OneZero FIX API session, is this possible?How do I calculate the number of requests I'll be making for a certain query?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We are selecting and managing the data sources that are used in the calculation based on multiple factors to provide data of highest quality.Algorithm is described below:Exchange rates are produced from quotes, trades, and metadata datasets.Symbols that are not data_type = ""SPOT"" are excluded from the calculation.Symbols from the data sources that were marked by us as not legitimate are excluded from the calculation.Quotes data where the spread is outside the range of <0$; 67%> are discarded. spreadPrc = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2)The midpoint from the quote data is used as a pricing reference and it's weighted by the passive cumulative volume resting on the best prices.Volume from the trades is used to weight the midpoint prices in the VWAP24 algorithm.Midpoint data that has not been updated in the last 5 minutes and 1 second is discarded.The last 24-hour volume for each symbol is updated every 4 hours when approximately 20% of the data in the sliding window changes (also, the list of eligible markets is updated at the same time).Everywhere in the algorithm below, we are using asset pairs only from exchanges that have the highest legitimacy rank, and the rest of the exchanges are discarded. As we establish the highest-ranking exchanges that have this data for each asset pair, we ensure that the highest quality data is used for each of them. The rank used for asset pairing is carried over to the following steps.Every 1 second, we update VWAP24 data for every asset pair across all data sources.For each asset pair, we also discard data that is outside the 3 sigma range if there are at least 3 exchanges for this asset pair.From the VWAP24 data, we are creating a tree structure where node/vertex = asset and edge = rate.By traversing the tree structure using the BFS algorithm and our secret sauce, we are able to establish the final exchange rates.📄️ Get all current ratesGet the current exchange rate between requested asset and all other assets.📄️ Timeseries dataGet the historical exchange rates between two assets in the form of the timeseries.📄️ Timeseries periodsYou can also obtain historical exchange rates of any asset pair, grouped into time periods.📄️ Get specific rateRetrieves the exchange rate for a specific base and quote asset at a given time or the current rate.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousREST APINext Get all current ratesCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame. This header indicates the number of requests that can still be made within the allocated quota for the current 24-hour period.GET v1/exchanges/ECB/apiKey-ED802AF4-E855-YOUR-API-KEYHost: coinapi.ioX-RateLimit-Used: 1000X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001ZX-RateLimit-Quota-Overage: ENABLEDX-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000Explanation:X-RateLimit-Used: 1000 (requests used in the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000 (total request limit within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000 (requests remaining within the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1 (cost or ""weight"" of each individual request)X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001Z (when the rate limit will reset within a 24-hour period)X-RateLimit-Overage: ENABLED (API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000 (total number of requests allowed for all API keys within the subscription within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000 (requests remaining within the subscription's allocated quota within the last 24 hours)Concurrency limit / APIKey​X-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum concurrent API calls/requests that the API could process for your subscription at the current moment.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

We will explore using the WebSocket protocol in Python, JavaScript, and Java to get live market data updates.Understanding WebSocket Protocol​CoinAPI provides real-time data through the WebSocket protocol. WebSocket allows for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making it an excellent choice for live data updates. The key endpoint for real-time data is wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/. To subscribe to a specific type of data, you need to send a subscription message after the connection is established.Python Example​In Python, we can use the websocket-client library to connect to CoinAPI's WebSocket API. If you don't have the websocket-client library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install websocket-clientHere's an example of real time trade data retrieval:import websocketimport json def on_message(ws, message): print(message) def on_error(ws, error): print(error) def on_close(ws): print(""### closed ###"") def on_open(ws): ws.send(json.dumps({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_USD$"" ] })) ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1"",        on_message = on_message,        on_error = on_error,        on_close = on_close)ws.on_open = on_openws.run_forever()This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesNote: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript Example​Makes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""ws"": ""^8.13.0"" }}In JavaScript, you can use WebSocket API:import WebSocket from 'ws';const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/'); socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"" ] }));}; socket.onmessage = function (event) { console.log(event.data);}; socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesInstall dependencies via npm install command. Execute your program in nodejs runtime environment with node your-script-name.js command.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript in web browser​Here's example which works directly in web browser, just create index.html file, paste code and start in web browser:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <title>Realtime Crypto Market Data Example</title></head><body> <script>  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };  socket.onmessage = function (event) {   console.log(event.data);   const contentDiv = document.getElementById('content');   contentDiv.textContent += event.data;  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  }; </script>  <div id=""content""> </body></html>Java Example​If you're using a Maven project, include Java-WebSocket and JSON dependencies in your pom.xml file:<dependencies> <dependency>  <groupId>org.java-websocket</groupId>  <artifactId>Java-WebSocket</artifactId>  <version>1.5.1</version> </dependency> <dependency>  <groupId>org.json</groupId>  <artifactId>json</artifactId>  <version>20210307</version> </dependency> </dependencies>Here's a Java example which uses WebSocketClient and JSONObject classes:import org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;import org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;import org.json.JSONArray;import org.json.JSONObject;import java.net.URI;import java.net.URISyntaxException;public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) {  try {   WebSocketClient socket = new WebSocketClient(new URI(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/"")) {        @Override    public void onOpen(ServerHandshake serverHandshake) {     JSONObject message = new JSONObject();     message.put(""type"", ""hello"");     message.put(""apikey"", ""YOUR_API_KEY"");     JSONArray subscribeDataType = new JSONArray();     subscribeDataType.put(""trade"");     message.put(""subscribe_data_type"", subscribeDataType);     JSONArray subscribeFilterSymbolId = new JSONArray();     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"");     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"");     message.put(""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"", subscribeFilterSymbolId);     this.send(message.toString());    }    @Override    public void onMessage(String message) {     System.out.println(message);    }    @Override    public void onClose(int code, String reason, boolean remote) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket closed"");    }    @Override    public void onError(Exception ex) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket error: "" + ex.getMessage());    }   };   socket.connect();  } catch (URISyntaxException e) {   e.printStackTrace();  } }}This Java program:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesBest Practices​Handle connection issues: internet connections aren't always stable. Implement reconnection logic for robustness.Handle rate limiting: even for WebSocket connections, CoinAPI has rate limits. Keep track of your message rate.Secure your API Key: do not hardcode your API key. Make sure it is kept secure, consider using environment variables or secure config files which are not committed to your version control system.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.Troubleshooting​If you're having issues, double-check the following:The API key is correct and has the required permissions.The WebSocket endpoint URL is correctly formatted.The subscription message contains a valid symbol_id.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.Stay tuned for more tutorials on advanced uses of CoinAPI!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousReal-time data visualization with javascriptNextRetrieve and analyze crypto order book data using a cryptocurrency APIIntroductionUnderstanding WebSocket ProtocolPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJavaScript in web browserJava ExampleBest PracticesTroubleshootingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

This information is important from the perspective that quotes data could be faster than order book data (behavior is dependent solely one the data source) and they can have the size equal to 0 when the size is unknown. Some data sources publish order books and separately quote data (without the sizes) at a higher frequency. In that case, we will merge the order book feed with quotes feed to make sure that our updates are as fast as possible. The quotes will have the size equal to 0 as the value is unknown and the customer can decide if these higher frequency updates without the sizes are valuable or if not then can discard them or ask for at least 2 order book levels (in case of a REST API call).

Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQChangelogWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?​CoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission​CoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio​CoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is handy for researchers who are not very familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers can access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?​CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don’t need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create a virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation. Clients can get all of their crypto APIs in one place, which makes it easier to manage large-scale crypto operations, trading, and data access.Still uncertain about how CoinAPI can help your business?

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

More information about the specific limits on each plan you can find on our Pricing page [1] and API Documentation [2].What are the risks of having multiple concurrent connections for Websocket?  Currently, subscriptions have a soft limit of a single concurrent connection for Websocket. If you are using multiple concurrent connections, the risk is in the fact that the credentials are shared between environments, and this could lead to misuse of the key or leakage affecting the production environment. If the key is misused, it could trigger some of the hard limits regarding concurrency that could affect the production.References:[1] https://www.coinapi.io/Pricing [2] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/websocket/general#limitsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousI received a reconnect message from WebsocketNextWhat are the time periods I can use for Exchange Rates and OHLCV?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

This is because our Exchange Rates data is produced from Quotes, Trades, and Metadata datasets. Quotes and Trades data are symbol-based (e.g BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT), and some assets may not have symbols available yet for the queried period.For example, the asset CVX was supported starting from 2020-05-05, but it returns zero price data from 2020-05-05 to 2021-06-06. If you check the symbols for the CVX asset with the v1/symbols endpoint, most of them start only in the year 2021. Exchange rates in this case works as intended. That is why there is no Exchange Rates data for this asset for this period.To learn more about the algorithm for Exchange Rates, we have a comprehensive explanation in our documentation here: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/exchange-ratesWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhy are limit headers not always showing on a request?NextWhy do some symbols have additional prefix?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

The key is needed to authenticate your application requests. Follow the instructions provided in CoinAPI's Getting Started Guide to set up your account.Setting Up Your React App​Begin by creating a new React application. You can do this using the create-react-app command or your preferred method. npx create-react-app coinapi-portfolio-tracker-appYou should have then following project structure:Get into the root of the folder in which package.json resides and check whether project is compiling & starting:npm startOnce your app structure is ready and project successfully compiles, open the App.js file. Copy and paste the following code into the App.js to see header displaying ""CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App"".import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() { return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Start application again using npm start:Retrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPI​CoinAPI provides the v1/exchangerate/asset_id_base endpoint for fetching the latest exchange rates of your assets. To request BTC/USD, ETH/USD and XRP/USD exchange rates from CoinAPI, we'll use useEffect hook and axios module to retrive data. This hook will fetch the exchange rates when the component mounts and then update the portfolio state. Add following code as part of the App.js:import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() {const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]);useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Note: Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with API key you have obtained via CoinAPI website.To make exchange rates appear in your web app, update the return part with following code:return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );Here's the complete App.js code:import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );}export default App;Before starting the application, make sure to install axios module via npm install axios command. Then start the application with npm start and check out the result:Styling Your Portfolio Tracker​Having fetched your portfolio data, you can now proceed to style your tracker. You can use raw CSS or opt for a UI library like Bootstrap or Material UI to enhance the look of your portfolio tracker. Here we'll use a css styling approach and following classes: portfolio, portfolio-item, asset-name and asset-rate. Extend GUI part with className attributes values as following: return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );then update index.css with css class implementation:.portfolio { padding: 1em;}.portfolio-item { display: flex; align-items: center; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;}.asset-name { font-weight: bold; margin-right: 10px; color: #007bff;}.asset-rate { color: #28a745;}.portfolio-item:hover { transform: scale(0.95); transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;}Retrieve data at regular intervals​Rather than repeatedly refreshing the application to obtain the most recent exchange rates, we can enhance it to fetch this data at specified intervals and automatically update the view. To update the exchange rates every 5 seconds, you can use the setInterval function in React.import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); // Fetch exchange rates every 5 seconds const intervalId = setInterval(fetchExchangeRates, 5000); // Clean up the interval when the component unmounts to avoid memory leaks return () => clearInterval(intervalId); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );}export default App;By following these steps, you'll create a basic cryptocurrency portfolio tracker using React and CoinAPI. For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs If you would like the data to be sent to you in real-time, check our Real-time data visualization with javascript or real-time trades stream using WebSocket with different languages how-to articles.Happy coding!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousAcquire exchange rates with different programming languagesNextCreating a historical crypto price chart using CoinAPI and D3.jsGetting Started with CoinAPISetting Up Your React AppRetrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPIStyling Your Portfolio TrackerRetrieve data at regular intervalsCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

CoinAPI is your one-stop solution for cryptocurrency data. We offer seamless access to real-time and historical financial data from hundreds of exchanges. Whether you're looking for raw trading data, OHLCV, or specific events, we've got you covered.We support multiple data delivery methods like REST, WebSocket, and more. Perfect for developers looking to build anything from trading algorithms to financial visualizations.Let's set it up 🚀​CoinAPI is your go-to platform for obtaining real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, featuring comprehensive API solutions suitable for developers and financial analysts alike. Coupled with D3.js, a javascript library for data visualization, you have the perfect toolkit for crafting sophisticated, real-time financial dashboards or trading algorithms. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to utilize CoinAPI's RESTful API in web environment to fetch cryptocurrency data. You'll also learn how to visualize data using D3.js.Getting Started​First, create a new project folder on your computer and name it crypto_price_chart. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.Setting Up the API Request​To fetch data from CoinAPI, we'll first need to make an API request. This will require an API key, which you can obtain by registering at the CoinAPI website.Code Snippet: Prepare index.html​Here's the basic structure of a web page designed to visualize cryptocurrency closing prices over a specified time period using D3.js.<!doctype html><html> <head> <title>Coinapi</title> <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js""></script> <script src=""script.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css""> </head> <h1>BTC Closing Prices Over Time</h1> <h3>(Data Period: 1 Day, Starting from January 1st, 2021, for 360 Days)</h3> <svg width=""800"" height=""600""></svg></html>Code Snippet: Fetching Data from CoinAPI​Create a function in your script.js to fetch historical data.const API_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"";const url = `https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?apikey=${API_KEY}&period_id=1DAY&time_start=2021-01-01T00:00:00&limit=360`;async function fetchData() { try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) {  throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); } const data = await response.json(); return data; } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching data:', error); throw error; }}Preparing the Data​After fetching the data, it needs to be prepared for charting. We'll create a simple function to transform the data into a format that D3.js can easily interpret. Add it to the end of script.js.Code Snippet: Data Transformation​function transformData(data) { return data.map(entry => ({ date: new Date(entry.time_period_start), price: entry.price_close }));}Now let's dive into building the chart.Code Snippet: building chart with D3.js​Add this code at the end of your script.js file.document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { const svg = d3.select(""svg""); // Select the existing SVG element in the HTML fetchData() .then(data => {  const transformedData = transformData(data);  // Define chart dimensions  const width = 800;  const height = 600;  const margin = { top: 50, right: 50, bottom: 50, left: 50 };  // Create a group for the chart elements  const chartGroup = svg.append(""g"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(${margin.left}, ${margin.top})`);  // Create scales  const xScale = d3.scaleUtc()  .domain(d3.extent(transformedData, d => d.date))  .range([0, width - margin.left - margin.right]);  const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()  .domain([0, d3.max(transformedData, d => d.price)])  .range([height - margin.bottom - margin.top, 0]);  // Create a line generator  const line = d3.line()  .x(d => xScale(d.date))  .y(d => yScale(d.price));  // Draw the line  chartGroup.append(""path"")  .datum(transformedData)  .attr(""class"", ""line"")  .attr(""d"", line);  // Add axes  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""x-axis"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(0, ${height - margin.bottom - margin.top})`)  .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale));  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""y-axis"")  .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale)); }) .catch(error => console.log(error));});Code snippet: styling the chart​Now, let's style your chart using the provided CSS. Add the following CSS to your style.css file:body, h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li { margin: 5; padding: 0; color: white;}/* Set a gradient background for the body */body { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #080059, #6C4CFC);}/* Style the SVG container */svg { background-color: transparent; /* Transparent background for the chart */}/* Style the chart line */.line { fill: none; stroke: #6C4CFC; /* Purple color for the line */ stroke-width: 2;}/* Style the x-axis */.x-axis path,.x-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for x-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.x-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the x-axis labels */}/* Style the y-axis */.y-axis path,.y-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for y-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.y-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the y-axis labels */}/* Style the legend */.legend { font-size: 16px; text-align: right; color: white; /* Text color for the legend text */}Testing Your Chart​Save all your files and open index.html in a web browser.

On the Enterprise Plan, it's possible to have direct access to the sites or set up AWS VPC Peering in that case latency between our infrastructure and the customer is below one millisecond. If the connection was established to the public endpoint, then it's routed using the GeoDNS to the closest site; latency then depends on the distance between the customer and the site where the connection was routed [~20ms].Was this section helpful?12345PreviousFIX API Logon TroubleshootingNextHow are exchange rates calculated?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

For example, ExchangeId and exchangeid are treated as equivalent keys.If a key and value is set in more than one configuration providers, the value from the last provider added is used.Using array indices in configuration keys are allowed.Hierarchical keysWithin the Configuration API, a colon separator (:) works on all platforms.In environment variables, a colon separator may not work on all platforms. A double underscore, __, is supported by all platforms and is automatically converted into a colon :.Configuration values:Are strings.Null values can't be stored in configuration.Configuration providers​You can set the values of configuration parameters for the components using the following providers (in case of collision for any specific key):Command-line argumentsEnvironment variablesEnvironment variables​To configure specific parameters using host or container environment variable, you must replace all occurrences of : with __ in the configuration parameter key, this is because the : separator doesn't work with environment variable hierarchical keys on all platforms. __, the double underscore, is:Supported by all platforms. For example, the : separator is not supported by Bash, but __ is.Automatically replaced by a :For example, to set the value of the configuration parameter OEML:ExchangeId to BITSTAMP you would need to set the environment variable named OMS__ExchangeId to BITSTAMP.Command-line arguments​You can set the configuration parameters by providing the arguments to the application executable.The following example sets keys and values using the =: OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP The following example sets keys and values using the /: /OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP The following example sets keys and values using the --: --OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP or --OEML:ExchangeId BITSTAMPThe key value:Must follow =, or the key must have a prefix of -- or / when the value follows a space.Isn't required if = is used. For example, MySetting=.Within the same command, don't mix command-line argument key-value pairs that use = with key-value pairs that use a space.Configuration parameters​KeyTypeDescriptionIs Required?Default valueOEML:ServiceDiscoveryModestringType of backend used for service discovery.

Whitelisting works by allowing you to skip CloudFlare. Here is an article on how to whitelist your IP addresses.Consul Configuration (optional)​The end result should look like this:{ ""datacenter"": ""hq"", ""data_dir"": ""C:\\consul\\data-hq"", ""log_level"": ""INFO"", ""server"": false, ""retry_join"": [ ""server-a"", ""server-b"", ""server-c"" ], ""ui"": true, ""http_config"": { ""response_headers"": {  ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"": ""*"" } }}If your deployment including optional Consul Cluster for the Service Discovery layer then it's required to change CORS settings of the local Consul client on the hosts where the EMS WebUI will be used. This step is necessary as we need to discover the address of the EMS API component.""http_config"": { 	""response_headers"": { 	 ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"": ""*"" 	} }Installation Manual​This section will provide the necessary information how to install the CoinAPI EMS software.Service discovery​The CoinAPI EMS API is capable of automaticaly detecting all your instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge service. This service discovery works by the one of the following methods:Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud, every time you start CoinAPI EMS Edge, it will register automatically in our central cloud infrastructure.Using the HashiCorp Consul Cluster.Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud is a default, simple, and straightforward method. Only one disadvantage of using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud over Consul Cluster is that we do not measure the latencies if one order destination is registered more than one time in the cluster for failover scenarios. Then CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud will connect to the last started exchange; however, when using the Consul Cluster, it will connect to the order destination in the closest proximity data center to the datacenter where CoinAPI EMS API is run.Running using an executable​To install the precompiled binary, download the latest version of the executable matching your system architecture from http://coinapi-releases.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Our software is currently packaged as a zip file, and we currently do not plan to distribute it another way. Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The self-contained binary inside is necessary to run EMS, and any additional files are not required to run the software.If you intend to access it from the command-line, make sure to place the binary somewhere on your PATH. You may require to add the executable to the system startup with all necessary parameters if you want the software to be started automatically after restart.Running on Docker​# example using only command line parametersdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTC \ --OD:PublicApiKey _public_api_key_ --OD:PrivateApiKey _private_api_key_ \ --CoinAPI:ApiKey _coinapi_api_key_ docker run -d --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-webuidocker run --net=host coinapi/oeml-cli# example with enviroment variables filecat > oeml.env << EOFCoinAPI__ApiKey=_coinapi_api_key_OD__PublicApiKey=_public_api_key_OD__PrivateApiKey=_private_api_key_EOFdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTCdocker run -d --name=BITFINEX --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId BITFINEXdocker run -d --name=OEML_EDGE --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.envOur software is listed in public docker repository. To run the software on docker, use the following images:coinapi/oeml-apicoinapi/oeml-clicoinapi/oeml-webuiTo pass the configuration parameters using the environment variables (more information about this feature is available in the Configuration Manual section of this documentation), the environment variables must be provided into the container and not set on the host machine.It's a good practice to lock itself into the specific version. To do that you can supply the version after image name and : separator, e.g. coinapi/oeml-api:1.1255Running on Kubernetes Cluster​Our software is compatible with Kubernetes, and you can quickly run it on the cluster using our (Helm Charts)[https://github.com/coinapi/helm-charts]. Follow steps below to perform quickstart deployment.Add the Repository to Helm​$ helm repo add coinapi-charts https://coinapi.github.io/helm-charts/$ helm repo updateHelm chart configuration​The example config below will create two api pods, a composite pod, and a webui pod. One exchange account corresponds to one entry in the values.yaml file. That means, for multiple exchange accounts, please add one config entry with the matching API keys for each account i.e. binance-01, binance-02, kraken-01, kraken-02, etc. A complete list of all supported exchanges can be found in the API documentation.cat > values.yaml << EOF# Using WebUI (oeml-api/values.yaml)webUI: enabled: true# Using composite (oeml-api/values.yaml)oemlCompositeAPI: enabled: true# Setting the CoinAPI key (oeml-api/values.yaml)extraEnv: - name: CoinAPI__ApiKey value: ""YOUR_COINAPI_APIKEY""# Specify listing of the accounts that EMS should manage (oeml-api/acct-dev.yaml)accounts: # Binance spot market - name: ""binance"" env:  - name: OEML__ExchangeId  value: ""BINANCE""  - name: OD__PublicApiKey  value: ""XXX""  - name: OD__PrivateApiKey  value: ""YYY""   # Binance spot testnet - name: ""binanceuat"" env:  - name: OEML__ExchangeId  value: ""BINANCEUAT""  - name: OD__PublicApiKey  value: ""XXX""  - name: OD__PrivateApiKey  value: ""YYY""  EOFInstall ems-api latest version​$ helm install oeml-api coinapi-charts/oeml-api -f values.yamlInstall ems-api custom version​Version listing available here. $ helm install oeml-api coinapi-charts/oeml-api -f values.yaml --set oemlAPI.tag={version}Verify installation​kubectl get pods | grep oemlExpected output:oeml-api-binance-7754fc95cc-x2gkk  1/1  Runningoeml-api-binance-test-757c8bbd95-2mxd5 1/1  Runningoeml-api-composite-d5688f8f6-csbwh  1/1  Runningoeml-webui-685cd94d77-hq68j    1/1  Running Inspect​Inspect binance api pod:kubectl logs oeml-api-binance-7754fc95cc-x2gkkInspect testnet api pod:kubectl logs oeml-api-binance-test-757c8bbd95-2mxd5Expected output for both api pods:[02:22:04 WRN] Overriding address(es) 'http://+:80'.

If the lowest latency is required, start the instance per location or server where the API will is used to minimize latency between API client and the EMS API Server.(optional) Run the CoinAPI EMS WebUI to have GUI to the cluster.Done! All the exchange accounts can be managed using the single API.Installation​CoinAPI EMS can be installed using several approaches:Running using an executableRunning on DockerRunning on Kubernetes ClusterOur software is compiled for the following architectures:linux-x64linux-arm64osx-x64osx-arm64win-x64 win-arm64Take a look at the Starter Guide of this documentation for more information how to run the software in the specific conditions.If you can't use any of those, let us know why that is a problem by creating a support case, and we will evaluate the possibility of extending compatibility.Upgrading​Currently, all components are stateless. Upgrading stateless components is limited to replacing the binaries or running the new docker image.Versioning & Compatibility​Our software is versioned using the Major.Minor(+branch) pattern. Major version number is incremented manually on our side, and its scope is for the EMS project. The Minor version number is incremented on every release automatically separately for every component.You can assume that our software components will work together when their Major version numbers are the same.Time synchronization​EMS highly depends on the current time to perform actions and correctly timestamp the data for real-time trading, risk management, compliance, or reporting.For the time synchronization we strongly recommending:chrony (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, macOS)w32tm (Windows)If you can't use any of the programs above for reasons like:Software has not been ported to my operating system.Software doesn't have a driver or it's not compatible with my hardware reference clock, and I can't use other programs like gpsd or ntp-refclock to provide reference time via the SHM or SOCK interface.Then it's worth trying solutions below (ordered from the best to worst options):ntp (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows)openntpd (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS)If need the sub-millisecond or sub-nanosecond accuracy take a look there:Meinberg Radio ClocksWhite RabbitLimits​This section will list all known software limitations.Limit descriptionLimit valueMaximum number of managed exchange accounts in a single clusterUnlimitedMaximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster host when running an executable65,535Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Docker or Docker Swarm1024Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Kubernetes250Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)from 4 to 737Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)100Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)250tipThere is no limit of exchange accounts that can simultaneously be managed using our EMS API.Integrations & Plugins​This section is reserved for Integrations, plugins or other external tools or modules that make it easier to work with EMS API.Prometheus metrics​In this section, we will describe the metrics exposed by the software on the /metrics endpoint.

CoinAPI offers extensive historical data across multiple cryptocurrency markets, which is critical for backtesting trading strategies, performing quantitative research, or even for creating visualizations. We will cover how to interact with our historical data endpoints using Python, JavaScript and Java.Understanding CoinAPI Endpoints​CoinAPI provides several endpoints for accessing historical data, including:ohlcv/period_id/history: Provides historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for specified periods.trades/symbol_id/history: Returns historical trades.quotes/symbol_id/history: Provides historical quotes.Remember, you need to replace period_Id and symbol_id with your desired period and symbol respectively.Python Example​Using Python, we can use the requests library to interact with CoinAPI. If you don't have the requests library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example:import requestsdef fetch_ohlcv(): url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"" headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" } # Replace with your API key response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) # Check if the response is successful if response.status_code == 200:  if response.content:   return response.json()  else:   print(""Response is empty."")   return None else:  # Handle other HTTP status codes  print(f""Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}"")  return None print(fetch_ohlcv())This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.JavaScript Example​Makes sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. In JavaScript, we can use the fetch API for sending requests to CoinAPI:First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Add following code and run npm install to install dependencies.import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00', { headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Java Example​In Java, we can use the HttpURLConnection class to send HTTP requests:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Best Practices​Store API keys securely: never hard-code API keys. Instead, store them in secure configuration files or environment variables.Handle rate limiting: be aware of CoinAPI's rate limits and handle 429 HTTP status codes gracefully in your application.Efficient data fetching: use query parameters like time_start and limit effectively to get the data you need without excess.Troubleshooting​In case you face any issues, ensure the following:Your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.You are not exceeding the rate limit for your account type.You are using the correct endpoint with proper request headers.The symbol and period IDs you are using are valid and in the correct format.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.For more information, you can check REST API OHLVC docsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousFetching market data with KNIMENextGet symbol funding rate metric data using CoinAPIIntroductionUnderstanding CoinAPI EndpointsPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJava ExampleCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

EMS - Starter Guide | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APISelf Hosted GuideREST APIWebSocket APIFIX APIEMS - Managed Cloud REST APIFAQChangelogEMS APIOn this pageEMS - Starter GuideThis section will provide general information about the Execution Management System API (EMS API) software product and enumerate a number of features that it provides.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.What is EMS API?​Execution Management System (EMS) is a software that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward manner. An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

More than one instruction can apply to an order. The table below describes how to interpret execution instructions parameter values. Legend: X - supported.InstructionShortcodeDescriptionAUCTION_ONLYAOAn Auction Only (AO) instructs exchange that this order is for the auction only book for the next auction. The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards. If the trader decides to increase their position before the reduce-only order is executed, the quantity of the reduce-only order will not increase as well.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific execution instructions by the Order destination.

To ensure that we promptly respond to your API calls and avoid unnecessary delays, we choose to provide a response without including the response headers. This decision is made with the intention of optimizing the operation of our API. By selectively excluding the inclusion of response headers in every request, we can enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the API.It takes a while to verify the current usage as for the very first call for a given client we do not have a rate limit then yet. Once the request is made, we start the rate limit verification process In the background. We may then in the meantime process many requests for this client and at some point we append the result of current usage to the header. All requests that were made during that process are also included in the limit after some time.For example (each bullet point representing a request made):Request (no info about clients usage)What's the usage? Starting the verificationRequestRequest5 requests used today (those 3 above are not counted yet), appended to the headerRequest (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (10 requests used today)To provide clarity and transparency regarding the absence of response headers, we have documented this behavior on our official documentation page, which can be found at https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#request-limit--apikeyWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhere can I find examples and SDK source codes for API?NextWhy are there no Exchange Rates data for some assets for a given period?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

For example, to calculate the exchange rates of BTC/USD, we also incorporate BTC/CNY, BTC/JPY, BTC/GBP, BTC/EUR.Exchanges are representing a different level of market data quality. To account for that factor our algorithm uses trustworthy exchanges first and if the data could not be produced using this set of exchanges, for example, a specific asset requested is not available on any of the trustworthy exchanges, then we are using all other exchanges to produce requested data. This approach of combining credible and less trusted data sources, giving our customers an overview of the whole market without compromising the data quality.Reference:[1] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/exchange-ratesWas this section helpful?12345PreviousGeographic locations and the LatencyNextHow can I get OHLCV data by asset pair?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

152,i.io authentication,"i.io authentication.   Authentication | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQChangelogAuthenticationOn this pageAuthenticationIn this section, you will find comprehensive information about the process of CoinAPI authentication. It covers the fundamental aspects and procedures involved in obtaining authentication for CoinAPI usage. Whether you are new to CoinAPI or seeking to enhance your understanding of the authentication process, this section will provide you with a valuable overview of the topic.There are different types of authentication methods available to secure and control access to its services.API Key - fundamental method of authentication that involves the usage of an API key for authentication and access control.API Key + JWT token - extended authentication method that combines the use of an API key along with a JWT token for enhanced security and authentication. Useful when you need to share the API Key publicly, for example when accessing the CoinAPI endpoints from the frontend JavaScript code exposed to the end-users. JWT token will be required along the API Key from the CoinAPI side to perform successful authentication, and the JWT tokens can be only generated from your side as you know the secret (private key or secret) based on which JWT token with the specified expiration time are issued.Authentication methods supported by the API​Here's an overview of the various products offered by CoinAPI and the supported authentication methods for each product. To use resources that require authorized access, you will need to use one of the many authentication methods described below.Product nameAPIX-CoinAPI-Key headerQuery paramURL pathAuthorization headerBasic authJWTTLS Client CertSenderCompIDAWS Signature Version 2/4Market DataREST✅✅✅✅✅✅❌❌❌Market DataWS✅✅✅✅✅✅❌❌❌Market DataFIX❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌Market DataS3✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅EMSManaged Cloud REST✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌EMSREST✅✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌EMSWS✅✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌EMSFIX❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌cautionIf you are using the Authorization header to pass the API key, please note that it cannot be used together with a JWT token. In case you have enabled JWT authentication, we recommend using alternative methods to pass the API key such as: a Custom authentication header, Query string parameter, or API Key in the URL.X-CoinAPI-Key header​You can authorize by providing an additional custom header named X-CoinAPI-Key and API key as its value.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, then the authentication header you should send to us will look like:X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYQuery string parameter (apikey)​You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named apikey with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY and that you want to request all exchange rates from BTC asset, then your query string should look like this: GET /v1/exchangerate/BTC?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYcautionThe Query string method may be more practical for development activities.URL path​To ensure proper authentication when passing the API key in the URL, it is important to format it correctly. The real API key should always be preceded by the APIKEY- prefix, followed by the actual API key. For example, if your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, the URL should be structured as /APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY.The API key can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of the URL path. Note that the key is completely ignored when determining the path of the requested resource. Here are examples of the different placements:At the beginning of the URL:/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/v1/exchangesIn the middle of the URL:/v1/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/exchangesAt the end of the URL:/v1/exchanges/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYPlease make sure to replace 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY with your actual API key for authentication and access to the requested resources and remember to include the APIKEY- prefix before your real API key.Authorization header​This method involves including the API key directly in the Authorization header of the API request.Authorization: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYBasic auth​Use Basic Authentication by setting the Authorization header with a base64 encoded string that combines your API key with a username (coinapi):Authorization: Basic Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk=In this example, Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk is a base64 encoded string of the username and API key (coinapi:73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY).JWT token​The JWT authentication method provides a secure and efficient way to authorize requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). With this method, JWTs can be passed via the Authorization header in the Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Supported JWT Algorithms​The JWT authentication method supports the following algorithms for JWT token verification with various key sizes:RSASSA-PSS (e.g. PS256)RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g. RS256)ECDSA (e.g. ES256)HMAC (e.g. HS256)Enabling JWT authentication​To enable JWT authentication for your API key:Access the customer portal and import the public JWT key (RSA or ECDSA) for the API key.Generate a JWT token using your private key (it ensures the authenticity and integrity of the token)Include the generated JWT token in the Authorization header of your API requests using Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Let the CoinAPI server verify the token's authenticity using the corresponding public key you've imported in Step 1 during the API request.Example request with JWT authentication​To include a JWT in an API request, add the token to the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The format of the header is as follows: `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN`Example request header with JWT token generated using RS256 algorithm:Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5ODViMmQ0ZC1kMjE1LTQwN2MtODcxNi01NTIzNjA0YmM0ZTIiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.ew0KICAic3ViIjogIjEyMzQ1Njc4OTAiLA0KICAibmFtZSI6ICJFWEFNUExFIFRPS0VOIiwNCiAgImlhdCI6IDE1MTYyMzkwMjIsDQogICJuYmYiOiAxNjg2MTM3MDI0LA0KICAiZXhwIjogMTcxNzY3MzAyNA0KfQ.CX6MWRSXQPKuQ_jrFCME91IwZhK8lq_2XrbDOyZ4-tPo0Ro52HA289sIfLo2LNafWQlq2lClfCN55TxyfC8n0xiifUwdec7g3kcGjCri6vTxaa8p6S3Fyyt2DxXccpi3Se4d_3mEQBZwMchKbQsw-W7Wj7njUk31ycgPQovvF4WrTuEYmhYw1sO9jCTORHmsSO7Shml7kv7AxlIUmzB2oq2KSmBhJV38Nz9oYj3KlPoMjgaIl4xYldNqnGyshh6fQyUQ1gQMQV6e4M5ro8YthjPOCvAT8yk77dTyOoE6Im58cAp6KtM-Gko-tWppUQTu-0M82LOvD_duP77n-hcoTwDecoded JWT token header:{ ""kid"": ""985b2d4d-d215-407c-8716-5523604bc4e2"", ""alg"": ""RS256"" }Decoded JWT token payload:{ ""sub"": ""1234567890"", ""name"": ""EXAMPLE TOKEN"", ""iat"": 1516239022, ""nbf"": 1686137024, ""exp"": 1717673024}JWT Token expiration​To ensure the validity of JWT tokens and prevent the use of expired tokens, the inclusion of the following claims is required:NBF (Not Before)The ""nbf"" claim specifies the earliest time at which the token can be considered valid. Tokens with a ""nbf"" claim set in the future should not be accepted.EXP (Expiration Time)The ""exp"" claim defines the expiration time of the token. Tokens with an ""exp"" claim set in the past should not be accepted.Request authentication​During the process of request authentication, the CoinAPI server follows a series of steps to ensure secure access to its resources. Here's an overview of the authentication process:Upon receiving the request, the CoinAPI server extracts the JWT from the Authorization header.Then, it verifies the JWT signature and checks the ""NBF"" and ""EXP"" claims to ensure token validity and expiration.If the JWT is valid and not expired, the server authorizes the request and proceeds with the necessary processing to access CoinAPI resources.If the JWT is invalid or expired, the server returns an appropriate error response.TLS Client Cert​TLS Client Certificate acquired from the Managed Cloud REST API (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) provided while establishing a TLS session with us.SenderCompID​This method of authentication is FIX protocol-specific. The exact message that needs to be sent to us will be described in the documentation of the specific API protocol Logon (35=A) message page.AWS Signature Version 2​Please in this method of authorization put the API Key in the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key fields.AWS Signature Version 4​AMAZON S3 uses the Authorization request header to provide authorization information. The value for this header must follow a specific pattern described as AWS Signature Version 4.The example below shows the Authorization header value compliant with AWS Signature Version 4.Please note that the Credential string contains our apikey as access-key-id. Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like:Authentication: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/20211203/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host; Signature=65e655c69da9906ac6076a28f75d9e4947aaed3be1f419757a3a84e24662673dAlthough AWS Signature Version 4 is very strict about each of the signature components, our API takes only our apikey value into account.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousWelcomeNextHow-to guidesAuthentication methods supported by the APIX-CoinAPI-Key headerQuery string parameter (apikey)URL pathAuthorization headerBasic authJWT tokenTLS Client CertSenderCompIDAWS Signature Version 2AWS Signature Version 4Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We'll use Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for data visualization.Prerequisites​Basic understanding of JavaScript and WebSockets.A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website).Familiarity with Chart.js (Visit the Chart.js documentation for more information).Visualizing Data with Chart.js​First, we'll create an empty chart using Chart.js. <!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we'll establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/ </script></body></html>The script creates a new line chart with an empty dataset. We'll fill in the data as we receive it from the WebSocket connection in next step.Setting Up the WebSocket Connection​We need to set up a WebSocket connection to CoinAPI and update chart: /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""] }));};socket.onmessage = function (event) {    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);    // Add new data to the chart  chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);  chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);    // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50  if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {   chart.data.labels.shift();   chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();  }    // Update the chart  chart.update();};socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Here's the complete code:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update chart with real time data **/  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };    socket.onmessage = function (event) {        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);        // Add new data to the chart    chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);    chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);        // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50    if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {     chart.data.labels.shift();     chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();    }        // Update the chart    chart.update();  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  };   </script></body></html>The onmessage event is activated whenever a new message (in our case, trade data) is received from the server. The message data is in JSON format, which we convert to a JavaScript object with JSON.parse().Our chart now updates in real-time as we receive trade data from CoinAPI!You're now equipped to use CoinAPI with JavaScript for real-time data visualization. Dive into the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies and explore with these powerful tools at your disposal.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame.

(exist only in case of the error)Concurrency limit / APIKey​X-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum allowed concurrent websocket connections per APIKey at the current moment. Every new WebSocket connection increases the Concurrency limit against quota, and when it's closed, decreases it.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-ConcurrencyLimit-LimitintConcurrency limit allocated for your API key.X-ConcurrencyLimit-RemainingintThe number of concurrent WebSocket connections available to be established in this moment for your API key.Data buffering​Data buffering JSON error message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""error"", ""message"": ""Reached maximum allowed buffered messages for this connection.""}The stream will send the data to the client as fast as possible; this can result in a high volume of data in cases where the subscription scope is broad. If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

The request limit restricts the number of maximum allowed newly initiated WebSocket connections per IP address in a time interval (sliding/rolling window ending at a specific moment) for your subscription. Limit prevents your client application from abusing the API by reconnecting in the loop without exponential backoff.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-LimitintValue of the limit quota allocated.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-RemainingintValue of the limit quota left at the moment, counted from last WindowSizeMs milliseconds.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMsintWindow size on which the remaining value was calculated in milliseconds.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMsintThe number of milliseconds after which Remaining > 0.

Limit prevents your client application from abusing the API by changing the scope of the subscription.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-WsHelloPerIpLimit-LimitintValue of the limit quota allocated.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-RemainingintValue of the limit quota left at the moment, counted from last WindowSizeMs milliseconds.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMsintWindow size on which the remaining value was calculated in milliseconds.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMsintThe number of milliseconds after which Remaining > 0. (exist only in case of the error)Concurrency limit / APIKey​X-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum allowed concurrent websocket connections per APIKey at the current moment. Every new WebSocket connection increases the Concurrency limit against quota, and when it's closed, decreases it.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-ConcurrencyLimit-LimitintConcurrency limit allocated for your API key.X-ConcurrencyLimit-RemainingintThe number of concurrent WebSocket connections available to be established in this moment for your API key.Data buffering​Data buffering JSON error message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""error"", ""message"": ""Reached maximum allowed buffered messages for this connection.""}The stream will send the data to the client as fast as possible; this can result in a high volume of data in cases where the subscription scope is broad. If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Covering everything from real-time exchange rates to detailed historical data, we delve into the key offerings of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. This guide provides a comprehensive overview, equipping you with the insights to effectively navigate the crypto market using the diverse CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. Real-Time exchange rates At CoinAPI, our crypto exchange rates, a key aspect of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API, are calculated using the 24-hour Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP-24H). This calculation is derived from a variety of high-quality data sources, with a specific focus on “SPOT” data types. We meticulously exclude any data from sources that are not deemed legitimate. Our approach involves a combination of quotes, trades, and metadata datasets, applying strict criteria for spreads in quotes and placing a strong emphasis on midpoint data for accurate pricing. Trade volumes are integral to our VWAP24 algorithm, another component of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. We give utmost priority to data freshness, updating the last 24-hour volume for each symbol every 4 hours and ensuring continuous updates every second. The algorithm is further enhanced with statistical filtering and a preference for high-ranking exchanges, ensuring the provision of the highest quality data. Lastly, we utilize a tree structure based on the VWAP24 data to determine the final exchange rates, guaranteeing that our users have access to the most current and accurate exchange rates as part of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API.  Historical analysis with CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API     CoinAPI offers a comprehensive solution for obtaining historical exchange rates between two assets, a crucial component of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API, presented in an intuitive time series format. This feature enables users to track and analyze the fluctuations in exchange rates over specific periods, providing valuable insights into market trends and asset performance. Whether you’re conducting in-depth financial analysis or simply monitoring market movements, our time series data, integral to CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API, equips you with the detailed historical information you need.     Timeseries periods CoinAPI enables you to delve into the historical exchange rates of any asset pair, conveniently grouped into various periods.

Trade volume data CoinAPI is renowned for its comprehensive trade data, a cornerstone of our market analysis tools. This data encompasses critical details such as the trading symbol, precise timestamp, transaction price, quantity, and the buyer’s and seller’s order IDs. Such depth and granularity make our trade data an essential resource for traders and analysts who require a real-time, nuanced understanding of market movements. Users can access the latest trades executed up to just 1 minute ago, with the most recent information always presented in descending chronological order. This ensures that you are always working with the most current and relevant market data available.

Order book data: Levels 1, 2, and 3 CoinAPI provides detailed order book data across three levels, each offering varying insights into market dynamics: Order Book Level 1 (L1): This basic level gives a snapshot of the market, ideal for a quick overview of current conditions and high-level market dynamics. Order Book Level 2 (L2): A more detailed level, L2 includes information on new and changing price levels, removed price levels, and individual trades, suitable for those needing deeper market insights. Order Book Level 3 (L3): The most detailed level, L3, offers comprehensive data including new, canceled, and matched orders, linking trades directly to order book orders. This is especially useful for high-frequency trading and detailed market analysis. CoinAPI’s REST API allows access to the current order book for specific symbols and their depth. Additionally, our WebSocket API provides real-time L2 order book data, ensuring the latest information is readily available for trading and analytical purposes. Order Book Snapshots CoinAPI offers a range of order book snapshots to suit various analytical needs, with intervals ranging from tick-by-tick to longer spans like 10ms, 100ms, 1s, and 10s. This variety allows users to choose the level of detail that best fits their trading and analysis strategies. The service includes: Order book snapshots feed (Level 2): Provides a complete snapshot of the order book with real-time updates, offering a thorough view of market dynamics. Book 5 – Order book snapshots feed (Level 2): Concentrates on the top 5 levels from each side of the book, giving a succinct yet detailed snapshot of market depth. Book 20 – Order book snapshots feed (Level 2): Broadens the scope to include the top 20 levels from each side, offering a more comprehensive look at market orders.

These diverse snapshot options from CoinAPI provide the tools necessary for close market monitoring and analysis, ensuring users have access to the detailed data needed for informed decision-making. Real-Time order book updates CoinAPI stands out for its ability to deliver real-time order book updates, a vital tool for market participants requiring the most current data. Each update from our platform includes comprehensive details such as the price level, the number of orders at that level, whether the orders are buy or sell, and the precise timestamp. These updates are transmitted within milliseconds, making them indispensable for trading strategies that depend on immediate market data. Additionally, CoinAPI offers a WebSocket endpoint for seamless real-time market data streaming. This feature ensures that users have continuous access to live market dynamics, enabling them to react swiftly to market changes and maintain a competitive edge in their trading and analysis. Quotes Quotes are crucial for traders and investors who depend on current information for making informed decisions. They typically include bid and ask prices, providing a snapshot of the current market demand and supply, and are a vital tool for assessing the market. In cryptocurrency, quotes are particularly important for algorithmic trading, where accuracy and speed are essential. They also form the basis for market analysis, aiding in identifying trends and gauging market sentiment. Additionally, quotes are used as reference points for executing trades, ensuring that transactions reflect the latest market conditions. Crypto OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) OHLCV data is a comprehensive summary of market activity within a specific timeframe, capturing crucial market movement aspects. This data is fundamental to technical analysis, helping traders identify market trends and patterns and providing insights into market psychology and potential future movements. It’s widely used in charting for visualizing market trends, creating trading indicators like moving averages and Bollinger Bands, and backtesting trading strategies. CoinAPI offers OHLCV updates for each symbol, with periods from 1SEC to 1MIN. Updates are sent when a period closes or every 5 seconds if the period has been updated but not closed, ensuring users have timely and accurate data for analysis and decision-making. Derivative Tick Info CoinAPI’s Derivative Tick Info provides essential data points for navigating the derivatives market, including: Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts, offering insights into the market depth and trader commitment. Funding Rate: The fee exchanged in perpetual contracts, reflecting the cost of maintaining positions and the degree of market leverage. Mark Price: The fair value of a derivative contract, used primarily in margin calculations to ensure fair trading. Index Price: The current price of the underlying asset in a derivatives contract, is crucial for contract valuation. This data is critical for participants in the derivatives market, aiding in understanding market dynamics, risk management, and assessing market health and sentiment. Traders use this information to gauge market sentiment, develop hedging strategies, and perform comprehensive risk assessments, making it an invaluable tool for informed decision-making in the dynamic world of derivatives trading. Liquidations Liquidations in trading occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s position due to their margin balance falling below the required maintenance margin, a measure to maintain the trading system’s integrity. These events are significant indicators of market volatility and the level of risk traders are taking on. High volumes of liquidations typically suggest extreme market conditions and can signal impending shifts in market dynamics.  This data is vital for thorough market analysis, aiding in evaluating market sentiment, identifying potential reversal points, and forming part of effective risk management strategies. Understanding trends in liquidations allows traders and analysts to gain valuable insights into current market conditions, enabling them to tailor their strategies more effectively. Trade volume data  Trade volume data measures the total cryptocurrency traded on an exchange within a specific period, acting as a key indicator of the exchange’s liquidity and the overall activity in the market. Its significance lies in its ability to reflect market dynamics; high trade volumes often correlate with heightened market activity and can signal the strength or importance of price movements. In market analysis, trade volume data is crucial for identifying trends, confirming chart patterns, and understanding supply and demand dynamics. Both analysts and traders depend on this data for informed decision-making, as it offers essential insights into market momentum and potential future trends. Latest Quotes Data CoinAPI provides the latest quote data for a broad range of cryptocurrencies, essential for high-frequency trading and strategies dependent on the most recent market data. This service is crucial for real-time trading systems where quick access to current market information is key to effective decision-making. It also plays a vital role in continuous market monitoring, helping traders and analysts keep pace with fast-changing market conditions. Quick traders, in particular, find this service invaluable for its ability to offer immediate updates, allowing them to respond rapidly to market shifts.  CoinAPI ensures users receive the latest updates for any chosen cryptocurrency symbol. New quote messages are triggered with each change in the order book’s top bid or ask level, providing an up-to-the-moment market snapshot. This commitment to delivering comprehensive, timely market data is exemplified by our Order Book Level 1 Feed, designed for efficiency and speed in updating the latest market quotes. CoinAPI’s blend of speed, precision, and thoroughness makes its latest quotes data a critical tool for traders and analysts in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Raw data CoinAPI distinguishes between aggregated and raw data types to cater to diverse data analysis needs. Aggregated data types, such as OHLCV and Exchange Rates, require a specific time period for aggregation, with our datasets starting from a minimum interval of 1 second. On the other hand, raw data types represent the pinnacle of real-time information, capturing every market nuance as it happens. This unaggregated, real-time data is disseminated continuously, ensuring that every update is promptly available. For those seeking the most granular level of market data, our historical API and flat files offer tick-by-tick data, accessible through our dedicated platform, Cryptotick.com. Providing the most detailed and granular data, raw data types are particularly valuable for custom analysis and the development of unique trading algorithms. Institutions and advanced traders leverage this data for conducting comprehensive market analysis, developing proprietary trading models, and for extensive research purposes. This level of detail and immediacy in data provision makes CoinAPI an essential resource for those requiring in-depth, real-time market insights. Flat Files CoinAPI’s Flat Files S3 API, a vital part of CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, is a RESTful interface designed for seamless access to data stored in flat file formats. This API is in line with Amazon S3 standards, offering the flexibility to integrate with existing Amazon S3-based infrastructure. While it shares similarities with Amazon S3, the Flat Files S3 API is specifically tailored for listing and downloading files, and does not cover the entire spectrum of Amazon S3 features. This specialized approach ensures that users can efficiently manage their data retrieval needs, a key aspect of utilizing CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, especially when accessing and downloading the extensive data archives provided by CoinAPI. Conclusion CoinAPI empowers users with the tools to make informed decisions, supported by detailed and real-time market insights. As a comprehensive cryptocurrency exchange API, we offer a wide array of data types, catering to various needs in real-time trading, historical analysis, and algorithm development.

The answer lies in our commitment to transparency and our understanding of the decision-making process you, our customers, undertake. We know that before making a final choice, exploring various providers of the cryptocurrency market data APIs is a critical step. At CoinAPI, we value honesty and openness above all, and we aim to provide the most comprehensive feature comparison to assist you in this important journey. This article is a personalized guide we’ve crafted to help you cut through the confusion and noise of the crypto data market. Our goal is to offer a clear, insightful understanding of this ever-changing landscape, empowering you to make a decision that’s not just satisfactory, but the absolute best for your specific needs and objectives. Join us as we explore the unique offerings, strengths, and potential drawbacks of various cryptocurrency market data API providers, helping you make an informed and confident decision in your crypto journey. Top cryptocurrency market data API providers To ensure our customers can make a clear and informed decision, we have prepared a deep analysis focusing on the most important features of top crypto data providers. This comparison table includes key factors such as integrated exchanges, depth of historical data, data granularity, various levels of order book data, and API offerings. By examining these critical aspects, we aim to provide a transparent and comprehensive view that simplifies your selection process in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading and analysis. Table 1,2: Data type and quality features Table 3: Access and performance features Choosing a cryptocurrency market data API provider When choosing a cryptocurrency market data API provider that suits your specific needs, several key considerations should be taken into account. Opt for providers who have demonstrated consistent uptime and have robust systems for data redundancy, ensuring that you have uninterrupted access to market data. Equally important is API functionality. It’s vital to evaluate how comprehensive the API endpoints are and whether they provide the detailed, real-time data streaming capabilities you require. Another crucial aspect is customer support. Providers who offer responsive and effective support should be a priority, as this is essential for quickly resolving any potential issues. Lastly, consider the balance between cost and features. It’s important to weigh the cost of the service against the features it offers, to ensure that you’re only paying for the functionalities that meet your specific needs. Disadvantages of other competitors when compared to CoinAPI  One major limitation of some competitors is their lack of real-time WebSocket data streaming, a crucial tool for live market monitoring. Additionally, the absence of FIX Protocol support in many services limits their attractiveness to institutional traders, who often rely on this standard for efficient financial information exchange. Another significant disadvantage is higher real-time latency, a major concern for those engaged in algorithmic trading where speed is of the essence. Furthermore, the lack of data redundancy and VPC peering in other providers raises concerns about data reliability and security, which are critical in today’s data-driven environment. Lastly, having fewer integrated exchanges limits the market coverage and depth of insight available to users. CoinAPI vs. Others CoinAPI, on the other hand, offers a RESTful API for easy integration and broad compatibility with various platforms and supports WebSocket for real-time data streaming, which is vital for applications that require immediate market insights. CoinAPI’s support for the FIX Protocol aligns it with the needs of institutional traders, offering a standardized method for financial information exchange. Our low real-time latency, below one millisecond, makes it ideal for high-frequency trading, where every millisecond can impact trading outcomes. CoinAPI’s infrastructure likely includes robust data redundancy, enhancing the reliability and uptime of its service. Incorporating VPC Peering is a notable enhancement in security, enabling private network connections that are especially beneficial for organizations with specific data privacy needs. Lastly, CoinAPI’s precise data timestamping, with millisecond accuracy, is essential for accurate trade execution and analysis. Conclusion The right crypto data provider can be a game-changer for your endeavors. We invite you to conduct your due diligence and consider CoinAPI for your data needs. For a hands-on experience with our platform, we offer a trial period so you can witness the CoinAPI advantage yourself. Contact us to get started with your demo today.

Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Company's entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that in the event Company does not meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage in given calendar month, Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Credit. “Unavailable Time” means the Company API is not available for use according to third party performance and monitoring services contracted by Company (the “Monitoring Service”). The Monitoring Service reports of availability will be accessible via the website operated by the third party. “Monthly Uptime Percentage"" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of continuous 1 minute periods during the Service Month in which the Company API was in a state of “Unavailable Time” as identified by Monitoring Service. Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer. For a calendar month where the Uptime Monthly Percentage, as identified by Monitoring Service, Company, at its sole discretion after confirming the nature and accuracy of the Unavailable Time, will credit Customer a percentage of that month❜s billings calculated as the average monthly value of the Service Fees, as defined by this table:+---------------------------+----------------+| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit |+---------------------------+----------------+| <99%| 100%|+---------------------------+----------------+To receive downtime credit, Customer must submit a ticket via the Support Portal within 30 days from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. The ticket must include:(a)""SLA Claim"" as the subject of the ticket;(b)the dates and times of the Unavailable Time for which Customer are requesting credit; and(c)any applicable information that documents the claimed outage. Such credits may not be redeemed for cash.4.9 Right to Change Content or Format.

Our deep understanding of the true value of cryptocurrency APIs shapes our advanced platforms, ensuring seamless access to crypto data and operations.  The emergence of cryptocurrency APIs The landscape of digital finance has been dramatically reshaped by the appearance of the cryptocurrency API, a technological marvel that has transformed how we interact with the world of crypto trading. Cryptocurrency APIs offer a window into real-time market data, turning what was once a complex web of information into an accessible stream of opportunities.  Before the growth of cryptocurrency APIs, developers grappled with the challenge of accessing accurate market data, often entangled in outdated information and complex processes. The emergence of cryptocurrency APIs marked a significant turning point. These tools have not only simplified access to live data streams and automated trading strategies for developers but also opened new possibilities for financial institutions. Now, they can create more sophisticated and efficient trading ecosystems. At CoinAPI, we’re at the forefront of this technological revolution, empowering our clients to harness the full potential of digital finance and trading. In-depth benefits of cryptocurrency API The cryptocurrency API offers a range of critical features essential for navigating the crypto market. The foremost of these features is real-time data access. In a market known for its rapid price fluctuations, the ability to access immediate, up-to-date information through a cryptocurrency API is not just advantageous; it’s a must. These APIs empower traders to make quick, informed decisions by providing them with timely and accurate market insights. User-friendliness and reliability are also key attributes of a good cryptocurrency API. Designed with intuitiveness in mind, these APIs ensure that developers can easily integrate them into various applications, avoiding the complexities of complex data structures. This user-friendly design is matched by the reliability of the cryptocurrency API, which is crucial for delivering consistent, accurate, and current data.  Moreover, the efficiency in development offered by cryptocurrency APIs cannot be overstated. By simplifying and streamlining data collection and analysis, APIs significantly cut down the time and effort required for these processes. This allows developers to shift their focus toward innovation and the optimization of their applications. The cryptocurrency API, therefore, not only accelerates the development cycle but also cultivates a more creative and productive environment in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading. The critical role of data collection At the heart of cryptocurrency API effectiveness lies the pivotal process of data collection. APIs excel in aggregating, processing, and storing data from a multitude of sources, ensuring that the information is not only comprehensive but also highly relevant and tailored for diverse applications. This includes everything from real-time market monitoring to advanced predictive analytics. Key to this proficiency is efficient data collection methods, such as streamlined data importing and bulk data downloading, which guarantee that the datasets are both extensive and immediately usable. Our approach to data collection is what sets us apart. We gather each data source from at least three independent server sites across key global regions: APAC, NCSA, and EMEA. In each of these regions, we strategically position ourselves in multiple locations, ensuring proximity to the exchanges for optimal data retrieval. Daily, all collected data converges at a single point where we conduct a unique process. Here, we replay every market scenario from the perspective of all data streams, synthesizing them into a singular, most accurate market stream. This method effectively addresses and eliminates any occasional discrepancies that might not be simultaneously visible across all server sites. In terms of real-time data delivery, we prioritize proximity and efficiency. The data is always routed from the nearest edge server, ensuring it never leaves the continent, thus maintaining speed and reducing latency. Additionally, we employ advanced delivery methods to our clients, including cross-connects or VPC peering connections, utilizing robust platforms like Equinix, AWS, or GCP. This approach not only enhances the speed and reliability of data transfer but also aligns with our commitment to providing our clients with the most accurate and timely market data possible.

Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer.

This is where Axyon AI comes in, providing asset managers with accurate AI predictive solutions. A team of experienced data scientists, software engineers, and quantitative finance researchers and analysts lead the charge in tackling the chaos of the crypto market.Our focus today is on Axyon AI's Chief Technology Officer, Jacopo Credi, who will guide us through the company's innovative crypto anomaly detection solution. By leveraging Market data API from CoinAPI, Axyon AI fortifies its investment platform against the uncertainties of the crypto market.

By monitoring transaction patterns, and exchange activity, and using analytics tools, Axyon AI can help identify potential anomalies and support decision-making. This can’t be possible without CoinAPI data allowing us to keep an eye on cryptocurrency exchanges for any unusual activity, such as large trades, price fluctuations, or sudden increases in trading volume."" explains Axyon AI Chief Technology Officer Jacopo CrediThe ChallengeAxyon AI faced the challenge of detecting anomalies in the volatile cryptocurrency market for accurate predictive analysis. Their goal was to find a reliable API providing precise cryptocurrency data that would enable them to pinpoint deviations in real-time in cryptocurrency assets. As a company deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence, Axyon AI has the capability to scrutinize massive amounts of data in real-time. This advanced analysis allows them to identify even the most subtle discrepancies, which can then be marked for further examination. Thus, their challenge was not just finding the right data, but also leveraging their sophisticated AI capabilities to turn that data into valuable insights.Here are the challenges Axyon AI facedLack of reliable, high-quality sources of historical and real-time cryptocurrency data to run crypto anomaly detection solutionAxyon AI encountered a challenge in finding trustworthy and high-quality streams of both historical and real-time cryptocurrency data. The obstacle they faced involved finding a comprehensive, single-source provider of all necessary cryptocurrency data. The alternative, integrating with various tools and manually sifting through each data source, was a cumbersome process that they aimed to avoid. Their goal was to find a streamlined solution that could seamlessly supply all the data they needed for their advanced analysis. Lack of aggregated dataAxyon AI faced a significant challenge due to the fragmented nature of information availability. The need to gather data from various sources presented an arduous and time-intensive task, necessitating individual research for each data segment. This lack of consolidated information was a major stumbling block in their quest for efficient and comprehensive data analysis.The manual process of getting data from multiple sourcesThe process of manually accumulating data from different sources is not only labor-intensive but also demands a certain level of expertise. The pursuit of market and cryptocurrency data involves sifting through a multitude of websites and vendors, which makes it exceptionally challenging to pinpoint a one-stop source for exhaustive data. Certain APIs may focus on specific cryptocurrencies or offer more extensive data on some than on others, further complicating the search for comprehensive and balanced information.The SolutionAxyon AI aimed to equip asset managers with advanced AI predictive solutions to ensure their success in the future. They were focused on providing their clients with an anomaly detection solution that could detect any irregularities in the cryptocurrency market. This enabled investors to make informed decisions and manage their investments with greater confidence.To achieve this, Axyon AI required reliable data on the crypto market. After thorough research, they decided to use CoinAPI as their data source due to its extensive and trustworthy coverage. With CoinAPI's dependable cryptocurrency information, Axyon AI created efficient machine-learning models to alert their clients of any potential disruptions or unusual behavior.“With CoinAPI, we have been able to develop effective machine-learning models which enabled us to warn our customers of potential market disruptions or unusual activity in a timely manner.

This has allowed Axyon AI to focus on improving its anomaly detection solution and AI models for business growth. CoinAPI handles the small details, freeing up Axyon AI to solely provide valuable services to their clients.Here's how Market data API from CoinAPI solved Axyon AI's challenges in running a crypto anomaly detection solutionGet access to Market data API with historical and real-time streamlined to run crypto anomaly detection solutionCoinAPI is capable of supplying real-time information on cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes.

Comprehensive coverage of cryptocurrencyCoinAPI, with its specialization in cryptocurrency data, offers broad coverage across a wide spectrum of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, among others. Their API delivers real-time pricing, historical data, trading volumes, order book data, and other pertinent metrics. By contrast, some other market data APIs might offer restricted coverage of cryptocurrencies, or possibly none at all. Hence, it's critical to select an API that caters to your specific demands in terms of the degree of coverage required.Save time and resources that would have otherwise been spent on data collection and processingEmploying a Market Data API can lead to significant savings in terms of time and resources that would have been expended on data gathering and processing.

As a result, they can now run their indexes in live time to track the dynamics of various cryptocurrencies. This covers a wide range of cryptocurrencies and allows for a more accurate analysis.“CoinAPI is a reliable real-time data feed provider for the indexes. The price/quality ratio is the best on the market. Being able to offer a real-time index gives us a great advantage, which is the primary benefit of partnering with CoinAPI” Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.Understanding the Power of Crypto Indices: Insights from Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30Cryptocurrency indices are crucial in monitoring the market dynamics of financial sectors in today's industry. Despite their vulnerability to significant cost unpredictability and administrative vulnerability, digital currencies have captivated the attention of a vast number of investors, making them impossible to ignore. In summary, digital currencies are here to stay, and indices allow products related to digital currencies to launch and enhance their presence within the conventional financial ecosystem.Crypto indices offer a simple way to get an overview of what is happening in the crypto markets. This saves time for crypto brokers and analysts who would otherwise need to search the entire market. For investors, crypto indices provide a way to diversify risk by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies at once. While mutual funds and ETFs are not yet prevalent in the crypto world, some people believe that investing in an index is a good alternative, allowing traders to diversify their portfolios with just one investment. Indices also make the cryptocurrency market more accessible and improve liquidity. The existence of indices can make non-crypto investors more inclined to take the crypto world seriously.CCi30, in order to be successful, needs access to reliable data, which is why they decided to use CoinAPI. To learn more about how the CCi30 crypto index tracks cryptocurrencies using real-time crypto data API, we spoke with Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.The ChallengeThe cryptocurrency market is unique and constantly changing, with new digital coins emerging and fading away on a daily basis. As cryptocurrencies have become a tradable asset class, there has been a growing need for an index product. CCi30 sought a reliable real-time data stream at a reasonable cost, and CoinAPI delivered just that - a high-quality data feed that is always accessible. In addition, CoinAPI offers customizable APIs that enable users to maximize their use of cryptocurrency data.“It was imperative to have access to dependable real-time data related to the index at a reasonable cost. This was essential for us because we wanted to provide our users with an accurate reflection of crypto market trends. Additionally, we were looking for a straightforward way to incorporate this information into our service without having to program it ourselves or hire someone else who would require a long period of instruction before being able to commence work.” Carlo said.Here are the challenges CCi30 facedLack of real-time crypto data APICCi30 faced a major challenge of procuring a market data API that could provide instantaneous access to both historical and real-time data on cryptocurrencies. They needed a streaming market data solution that could offer more than just minute or daily bar data.    Spending a lot of time collecting data from various resources CCi30 was struggling to gather necessary information from multiple sources, which was proving to be a time-consuming process. They were on the lookout for a partner who could join them quickly and provide all the required data. The task of combining data from different free sources, gathering it from various locations, and then making sense of it was challenging and frustrating. It would take a considerable amount of time to accomplish this task.Poor data qualityThe market data API's poor quality is a major issue for businesses that require trustworthy data to make informed decisions. These APIs are frequently unreliable, providing incorrect pricing information or outdated data. Furthermore, they may be slow or have other technical problems that make them difficult to work with. This all contributes to an unpleasant and unreliable market data API experience.The solutionCCi30 had to find a dependable real-time data feed to stay current in their ever-evolving industry. This was a crucial aspect of their index that was previously missing. With the help of CoinAPI’s real-time data feed, CCi30 can now provide their users with a precise index that is refreshed daily.“To be successful in the index industry nowadays, it is essential to have the capacity to analyze a huge amount of data from numerous sources and to calculate it accurately and quickly. Fortunately, there has been improvement in this area, and CCi30 is one of the major actors in the indices arena. Through CoinAPI, CCI30 can access thorough prices and market understanding of a wide selection of assets.” Carlo said.The CCi30 Cryptocurrency Indices were established to bring transparency to the constantly evolving market in a systematic manner. To create the indices, CCi30 Indices collected pricing information from CoinAPI, a dependable market data API provider known for its advanced services in the crypto asset industry.CCi30 opted to use CoinAPI's feed due to its reliability and affordability. CoinAPI provides price data for over 16,000 digital assets, including many cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Litecoin. The pricing data is sourced from more than 300 digital exchanges, which include the largest and most trusted ones, providing a significant portion of market liquidity.Results“CoinAPI's up-to-date data feed has helped us to make the cryptocurrency market more transparent by supplying accurate details about the behavior of individual digital currencies and the influence they have on other tokens in this ever-changing landscape.”CoinAPI provides real-time data to track the dynamics of various cryptocurrencies, making it easily accessible for software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. They cover a wide range of cryptocurrencies and aim to create the most user-friendly APIs for their clients.CCi30 aggregates real-time price data from major exchanges on almost all distributed-ledger cryptocurrencies, making it the most comprehensive and accurate pricing benchmark in the industry. It tracks the 30 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins such as Monero, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic.Launched in 2017, CCi30 was created by a team of fund managers, mathematicians, and quantitative analysts. It is the most prominent index for cryptocurrencies and includes other tokens such as Litecoin, Ripple (CRP), and Monero in its index methodology.Here are the results CCi30 saw using CoinAPIReal-time stream of crypto data APIThe CCi30 team can now efficiently retrieve all financial reference, real-time pricing, historical pricing, and indices data related to trading currencies, currency derivative instruments, short-term money market instruments, and interest rate derivatives. This faster access to data enables the team to cover all aspects of trading comprehensively.     A reliable source of dataIt can be quite challenging to come across dependable data. Luckily, there is a trustworthy CoinAPI provider available. CoinAPI is a reputable source that offers both real-time and historical data to the financial markets.Have deep coverage of the cryptocurrency spaceThere are many indices available that measure the performance of the leading cryptocurrencies. However, these indices typically only cover a small number of coins and do not offer the same level of diversification as investing in a portfolio of stocks. This can make it difficult for investors to achieve meaningful diversification. Furthermore, these indices do not necessarily provide an accurate representation of the entire cryptocurrency market. Fortunately, the CCi30 index, powered by CoinAPI, is able to offer a broader range of assets for investors to consider.Reduce the volatility of trading prices and present a more stable price pointThe prices in the trading market can be highly unstable and uncertain. However, with CCi30 as your partner, the volatility is mitigated, and a more consistent price point is presented. This ensures that the risk of significant price swings is minimized, and the downside risk is reduced since the maximum price that a buyer or seller is willing to offer is already predetermined.“We are absolutely delighted to be partnered with CoinAPI. It is a firm that is driven by engineering and is highly focused on creating products. Their primary target is to offer the simplest and most convenient APIs to software developers and tech-savvy investors.

We use CoinAPI to power our tax calculation,""explains Bitcoin.tax CEO Colin MackieThe Importance of Cryptocurrency Tax Software and CoinAPI IntegrationCrypto taxes are gaining significance among investors and traders due to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. It has become essential for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market to understand crypto taxes, especially with the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. Although crypto taxes can be complicated, they can be managed with the right software. The emergence of digital currency has sparked an interesting debate among investors and governments worldwide regarding how crypto taxes should be handled. As more people invest in digital currency, the need to properly calculate taxes has become increasingly important.Calculating taxes related to cryptocurrencies is a complex process, and different countries have different regulations. Hence, cryptocurrency tax experts are in high demand to help investors manage their crypto tax-related obligations. Bitcoin.tax is one such company that provides such services, and we recently interviewed its CEO Colin Mackie. He explained why integration with CoinAPI is crucial for tax and accounting companies.""Individuals trading in digital currencies are required to pay taxes, and for this to be done efficiently, they need software that can precisely calculate their capital gains and losses.

CoinAPI offers historical price data gathered from commonly used exchanges and a real-time feed of trades occurring on those exchanges. By linking with the API, Bitcoin.tax can identify taxable transactions, calculate gains, losses, and income to create multiple crypto tax reports, which can help investors in filing with their country's tax agencies quickly and efficiently.""Our partnership with CoinAPI is focused on delivering the most dependable historical and current cryptocurrency data for tax computation.

Similarly, to get crypto tax data, one has to browse through various crypto exchanges to locate the appropriate data.The solutionBitcoin.tax has chosen CoinAPI as its go-to source for cryptocurrency data.
