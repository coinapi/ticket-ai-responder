After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"":""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"":""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"", }Was this section helpful?12345PreviousHow to use CoinAPI from Matlab?NextWhat are the restrictions on usage of real-time protocols?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

3,i.io ,"i.io .   Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?​CoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission​CoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio​CoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is handy for researchers who are not very familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers can access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?​CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don’t need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create a virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation. Clients can get all of their crypto APIs in one place, which makes it easier to manage large-scale crypto operations, trading, and data access.Still uncertain about how CoinAPI can help your business?

When the request is failed with a 550 error and when the empty response (empty JSON array, XML, or CSV) is delivered?Answer:​In the, for example, REST OHLCV data, you are requesting the data in the time range and receiving the collection (JSON Array) in response, which could contain 0 or multiple objects. When we don't have the object, then it will be not visible in the array, and if there are no objects in the range, then the collection will be empty. It's a correct response, and it's a better solution than responding with a 550 error as the response is correct from the data structure perspective.The 550 error code is related to the specific object requested (JSON object) like the current exchange rate between BTC/USD. In this type of request, we need to respond with a single object, and when we do not have it, then the whole request will be failed with a 550 HTTP response code.The OHLCV periods are not generated when there are no trades in the period as min, max, first, last (low, high, open, close) are undefined. We have the parameter include_empty_items which you can use to display those items, but only time_period_start, time_period_end will be visible. More information is available in the relevant sections of the documentation: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/ohlcv https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#http-requestsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousOHLCV Aggregation using the REST APINextShould we file a ticket every time?Question:Answer:Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Once you have it, you can proceed to retrieve the data using Python.Fetching the dataimport requestsimport jsonAPI_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE""url = f""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/orderbooks/current?symbol=KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD&apikey={API_KEY}""response = requests.get(url)if response.status_code == 200: # The request was successful data = response.json()  # Save the data to a file with open(""order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"", ""w"") as file:  json.dump(data, file, indent=4) print(""Data saved to order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json"")else: # Handle error cases print(f""Error: Status code {response.status_code}"") print(response.text)Response{ ""symbol_id"": ""KRAKEN_SPOT_BTC_USD"", ""time_exchange"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""time_coinapi"": ""2023-11-24T08:26:46.6928657Z"", ""asks"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.1,   ""size"": 19.23618731  },  {   ""price"": 37549.9,   ""size"": 0.08242079  },  /// other entries omitted for brevity ], ""bids"": [  {   ""price"": 37549.0,   ""size"": 0.136004  },  {   ""price"": 37545.1,  }  /// other entries omitted for brevity ]}Data Analysis and Metrics​Upon data retrieval, the next step involves data analysis using Python. The obtained data typically represents a snapshot of buy and sell orders in the market at a specific moment. This data consists of two key components: bids and asks. Bids signify the price levels at which buyers are willing to acquire an asset, while asks represent the price levels at which sellers are willing to sell it. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is referred to as the spread.Here is a comprehensive list of common metrics and analytical procedures:Order Book Depth - visualize the liquidity available at various price levels.Order Imbalance - analyze the disparity between bids and asks to gain insights into market sentiment.Price Levels - identify significant price levels characterized by substantial volumes of bids or asks.Market Spread - compute the current bid-ask spread as an indicator of market liquidity.Order Book Depth Visualization​In this Python code, we demonstrate how to visualize the order book depth of a cryptocurrency trading pair using Matplotlib.import jsonimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to visualize order book depth chartdef visualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  bid_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in bids] bid_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in bids]  ask_prices = [entry[""price""] for entry in asks] ask_sizes = [entry[""size""] for entry in asks]  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(bid_prices, bid_sizes, label=""Bids (buyers)"", color=""green"") plt.plot(ask_prices, ask_sizes, label=""Asks (sellers)"", color=""red"") plt.xlabel(""Price"") plt.ylabel(""Size"") plt.title(""Order Book Depth"") plt.legend() plt.show()# Visualize the order book depthvisualize_order_book_depth(order_book_data)The following visualization is the result of the Python script demonstrated above.Order Book Depth Visualization:is a measure of the quantity of buy and sell orders available for a particular financial assetit provides insight into market liquidity and the willingness of traders to buy or sell at different pricesmay be used for trading decisions, as it reveals potential price trendsOrder Imbalance, Price Levels, Market Spread​In this Python code, we explore order imbalance, significant bids & asks, market spread metrics for a BTC/USD trading pair.import json# Function to read order book data from a JSONdef read_order_book_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  order_book_data = json.load(file) return order_book_datafile_path = 'order-books-kraken-spot-btc-usd.json'# Read order book data from the file we've obtained in the previous steporder_book_data = read_order_book_data(file_path)# Function to calculate order imbalancedef calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data): bids = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""bids""]) asks = sum(entry[""size""] for entry in order_book_data[""asks""]) order_imbalance = (bids - asks) / (bids + asks) return order_imbalance# Function to identify significant price levelsdef identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, threshold=50): bids = order_book_data[""bids""] asks = order_book_data[""asks""]  significant_bids = [entry for entry in bids if entry[""size""] > threshold] significant_asks = [entry for entry in asks if entry[""size""] > threshold] return significant_bids, significant_asks# Function to calculate market spreaddef calculate_market_spread(order_book_data): best_bid = order_book_data[""bids""][0][""price""] best_ask = order_book_data[""asks""][0][""price""]  spread = best_ask - best_bid return spread# Common metrics calculationorder_imbalance = calculate_order_imbalance(order_book_data)significant_price_threshold = 20significant_bids, significant_asks = identify_significant_price_levels(order_book_data, significant_price_threshold)spread = calculate_market_spread(order_book_data)print(""******************************"")print(""Order Imbalance:"", order_imbalance)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Bids:"", significant_bids)print(""***************************"")print(""Significant Asks:"", significant_asks)print(""***************************"")print(""Market Spread:"", spread)print(""***************************"")Result> ******************************> Order Imbalance: -0.012400502029283922> ***************************> Significant Bids: [{'price': 37440.7, 'size': 24.73909889}, {'price': 36451.0, 'size': 25.0}]> ***************************> Significant Asks: [{'price': 37749.0, 'size': 25.0}, {'price': 37840.0, 'size': 24.08119208}, {'price': 38000.0, 'size': 29.60579175}, {'price': 39000.0, 'size': 21.75395535}, {'price': 40000.0, 'size': 58.28620718}]> ***************************> Market Spread: 0.09999999999854481> ***************************Calculated metrics:order_imbalance - it measures the difference between the total volume of buy orders and sell orders. It provides insights into the overall market sentiment by indicating whether there is an excess of buying or selling interest.significant_price_threshold is a predetermined value (set to 20 in this case) used to identify price levels in the order book that are considered significant. It helps traders focus on specific price points that may have a more substantial impact on the market.significant_bids and significant_asks are lists of price levels derived from the order book data that meet or exceed the significant_price_threshold. These levels are typically associated with higher trading activity and may be seen as key support and resistance levels.spread is a metric that calculates the difference between the best bid and best ask prices. It represents the cost of executing a market order and is a fundamental factor for traders to consider when entering or exiting positions.Summary​This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge and tools necessary to fetch and analyze cryptocurrency order book data using CoinAPI and Python.

Bandwidth bottleneck2. Lack of the separation between the receiving thread and parsing, processing operations3. No CPU affinity on the receiving thread4. CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread5. Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack6. Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressureIf your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above then these things will happen:1. Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to you2. Our TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more data3. We will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)4. We will start dropping the messagesMore information is available by googling ""TCP Flow Control"".Was this section helpful?12345PreviousHow long does it take to integrate CoinAPI?NextHow to be notified about the issues/incidents?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Below are examples of integrating with two popular exchanges:BITMEX exampleKRAKEN exampleinfoWhile the examples in this quickstart provided are focused on integrating with BITMEX and KRAKEN, the process is quite similar for various exchanges.BITMEX​BITMEX stands as a premier cryptocurrency exchange, offering a robust platform for traders and investors worldwide.Obtain Public key​To begin trading on BITMEX, you'll need to obtain your public and private keys from BITMEX.Connect your account​After acquiring keys, the initial step includes sharing your exchange keys through the account creation process for the designated exchange.import requestsimport jsonurl = ""https://ems-mgmt.coinapi.io/v1/accounts""payload = { ""exchange_id"": ""BITMEX/JOHN"", ""parameters"": [  {   ""key"": ""PublicApiKey"",   ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PUBLIC-KEY-FROM-BITMEX""  },    {   ""key"": ""PrivateApiKey"",   ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PRIVATE-KEY-FROM-BITMEX""  } ]}headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-COINAPI-KEY"", ""Content-Type"": ""application/json""}# Convert payload to JSON stringjson_payload = json.dumps(payload)# Make the requestresponse = requests.post(url, data=json_payload, headers=headers)# Print the responseprint(""Response Code:"", response.status_code)Once the update is successful, you'll receive an HTTP status code of 200.KRAKEN​Obtain Public key​To begin trading on KRAKEN, you'll need to obtain your public and private keys from KRAKEN.Connect your account​After acquiring keys, the initial step includes sharing your exchange keys through the account creation process for the designated exchange.import requestsimport jsonurl = ""https://ems-mgmt.coinapi.io/v1/accounts""payload = { ""exchange_id"": ""KRAKEN/JOHN"", ""parameters"": [  {   ""key"": ""PublicApiKey"",   ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PUBLIC-KEY-FROM-KRAKEN""  },    {   ""key"": ""PrivateApiKey"",   ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PRIVATE-KEY-FROM-KRAKEN""  } ]}headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-COINAPI-KEY"", ""Content-Type"": ""application/json""}# Convert payload to JSON stringjson_payload = json.dumps(payload)# Make the requestresponse = requests.post(url, data=json_payload, headers=headers)# Print the responseprint(""Response Code:"", response.status_code)Get the list of Connected Exchanges​To check which accounts have been created on our side, execute the following code:import requestsimport jsonurl = ""https://ems-mgmt.coinapi.io/v1/accounts""headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-COINAPI-KEY""}# Make the requestresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)if response.status_code == 200: accounts_json = response.json() print(json.dumps(accounts_json, indent=4))else: print(""Error:"", response.status_code)Here's an example response, listing all accounts created with your API KEY:[ {  ""exchange_id"": ""BITMEX/JOHN"",  ""parameters"": [   {    ""key"": ""PublicApiKey"",    ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PUBLIC-KEY-FROM-BITMEX""   },   {    ""key"": ""PrivateApiKey"",    ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PRIVATE-KEY-FROM-BITMEX""   }  ] }, {  ""exchange_id"": ""KRAKEN/JOHN"",  ""parameters"": [   {    ""key"": ""PublicApiKey"",    ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PUBLIC-KEY-FROM-KRAKEN""     },   {    ""key"": ""PrivateApiKey"",    ""value"": ""73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-PRIVATE-KEY-FROM-KRAKEN""   }  ] }]Trades execution​Placing an order on an exchange involves providing instructions for executing a trade at a designated price and quantity.Check balance (Optional)​Before diving into trading, it's a good idea to check the balance on your account(s).

In this guide, we will specifically concentrate on extracting data in CSV (comma-separated-values) format using a simple approach that involves accessing data directly through a web browser. CSV is widely used due to its simplicity and compatibility with various spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.Getting started​Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have:Web browser installed: google chrome, firefox, microsoft edge, or any otherA CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)A spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or Google SheetsRetrieve BTC Exchange Rates in .csv format via web browser​It is possible to control the format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters. To get BTC exchange rates in csv format, copy and paste the below URL to the address bar of your web browser:https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY-ed802af4-e855-4505-AEA&output_format=csvNote: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Simple then press ctrl+a or command+a to select exchange rates, then press ctrl + c to copy data. After obtaining the data, you can seamlessly paste it directly into any text editor.Then, select the Save As option, and don't forget to include the .csv file extension.CSV import: Microsoft Excel​To import the .csv file into the MS Excel application, navigate to the Data tab, and choose the From Text/CSV option.Select your .csv file which includes BTC exchange rate data in csv format.Verify the output of import in the preview window.With these simple steps, you can now efficiently work with and analyze the market data in a familiar spreadsheet environment, empowering you to make informed decisions based on the exchange rate information. CSV import: Google Sheets​To import the .csv file into the Google Sheets application, navigate to the File menu.Within that menu, select the Import option.Upload your .csv file which includes BTC exchange rate data.Make sure to set the correct Import location and Separator type, then press Import data.Here's the final result:With these simple steps, you can now efficiently work with and analyze the market data in a familiar spreadsheet environment, empowering you to make informed decisions based on the exchange rate information. Summary​We have explored a simple approach to accessing market data in CSV format directly through a web browser. By utilizing this method, you can easily extract the data you need for analysis and integrate it with various spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.While the simple approach through a web browser provides easy access to market data in CSV format, there is cryptotick specialized platform that offers a wide range of market data types in the csv format, including quotes, trades, limit order book, OHLCV, and others.Happy data exploration!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousImport API into PostmanNextReal-time data visualization with javascriptIntroductionGetting startedRetrieve BTC Exchange Rates in .csv format via web browserCSV import: Microsoft ExcelCSV import: Google SheetsSummaryCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

If possible then we are strongly recommending using our tested libraries available on GitHub, rather than creating new ones. However, if you decide to create your implementation or to change the existing one, then we encourage you to create a Pull Request to our main repository with the proposed changes, we will able to include your code in our official repository for use by other users, effectively creating collaboration.In the repository, you can find libraries or examples for languages or environments like:PythonRMatlabC#C++.NETJavaRubyGoJavaScriptTypeScriptNode.jsPHPHaskellObjective-CSwiftSecurity​The use of encryption is optional, and the decision to use it is on you. On the encrypted endpoints, we are using protocols that are considered the best security practices.tipYou should assume that we are always providing certificates signed by the Trusted Certification Authority.Standards and conventions​This section represents used standards and conventions across all documents and API's.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.Variables naming​All variables are named using the Snake case (or snake_case) naming convention. This means that words are separated by a single underscore _ character, no spaces are used, and letters are lowercase.Asset codes​ISO 4217 currency code standard is used for fiat money identifications. Cryptocurrency assets are identified using codes used by the general public or adopted by the majority of exchanges.Exchange codes​Exchange on our platform is identified by the specific exchange API and the matching engine behind it. When the example exchange has multiple separate APIs, e.g., for different products SPOT, OPTIONS, or to cover other regions, we will expose these symbols from these respective APIs on different exchange identifiers. Below are examples of BINANCE (multiple APIs, multiple regions) and DERIBIT (single API, single region).

In the Customer Portal, navigate to Subscriptions > APIKEYS > CREATE APIKEY It is important to note that the existence of each additional API Key for a subscription (enabled or disabled) above the plan quota is charged 1 USD per day, with a minimum of one dayThe multiple API keys can be limited via the configuration of the specific API key, for example, the specific API key newly created cannot overage or limit the specific API key to X number of requests to avoid causing issues for other keys. Increased security is one of the main benefits of having numerous API keys. Each key acts as an access point and particular identifier. Users can compartmentalize their access by making unique keys, which lowers the likelihood that a security breach will have a negative effect. The remaining keys are unaffected if one key is hacked, protecting sensitive information and reducing risks.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousCan I get the XML or CSV instead of the JSON output format?NextCan I have multiple subscriptions?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

This means for example that BTC/USD component of the rate could be composed of the BTC/ETH * ETH/USDT * USDT/USD crosses. In this rate type, we want to express the true value of the asset by seeking markets that have volume/activity and not blinding ourselves only to the direct crosses that in the crypto industry will often not represent the majority of the price discovery activity.

""BTC/USD 1 / (USDC/USD) = BTC/USD USD/USDC = BTC/USDC""Reconnect IN​Reconnect message is sent by the server to all connected clients when the server will be restarted or shut down at the defined exact time included in the message content. After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"": ""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"",}Message variables​VariableDescriptiontypeMessage type, always reconnectwithin_secondsSeconds within which reconnection should be performed.before_timeTime before which reconnection should be performed.Heartbeat IN​Heartbeat message JSON is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""hearbeat""}Heartbeat message is sent to you every time there is one second of silence in communication between us, if you agreed on this feature in Hello message.tipWebSocket working on TCP protocol which doesn’t have the feature indicating that the connection is broken without trying exchange data over it. As you will not be actively sending messages to us, with Heartbeat you can distinguish a situation where there are no market data updates for you (Heartbeat is delivered but no market data updates) or connection between us is broken (Heartbeat and market data updates are not delivered).

This tutorial walks you through the process of using CoinAPI's API to access exchange rate data using Python, Javascript, and Java. The objective here is to equip you with the necessary know-how to utilize our API for your crypto projects.Prerequisites​A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)A basic understanding of at least one programming language: Python, Javascript or JavaAPI Key generation​Before we dive into code, it's crucial to understand that to use the CoinAPI, you need an API key. This key identifies your application and authorizes requests.Visit the CoinAPI websiteRegister an account or log in if you already have oneNavigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API keyRemember to store your key safely - it's your credential!Making an API Request with Python​To connect to CoinAPI in Python, we'll use the requests library. If you don't have the 'requests' library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example of the access-coinapi-data.py Python script:import requestsdef fetch_data():url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD""headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR-API-KEY"" # Replace with your API key}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)return response.json()print(fetch_data())This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. To execute the script, run python access-coinapi-data.py command.> python access-coinapi-data.py{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Javascript​Make sure to install the nodejs runtime environment before. Add package.json with node-fetch module dependency.{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Create file access-coinapi-data.js with the following code:import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD', {headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This example fetches the current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Install dependencies via the npm install command. Execute your program in the nodejs runtime environment with the node access-coinapi-data.js command.> node access-coinapi-data.js{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Making an API Request with Java​Make sure to install Java Development Kit (JDK) as it includes a runtime environment (JRE) plus additional tools and utilities required for Java development. To check whether JRE and JDK are already installed on your system you may use the java -version command.Java offers multiple ways to send HTTP requests. Here we'll use the HttpURLConnection class. Create Main.java file with the following content:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the current exchange rate of Bitcoin (BTC) to USD. Use the javac Main.java command to compile the java source file into bytecode. The resulting bytecode file will be named Main.class. After the compilation step, you can execute the program using java Main to see the exchange rate output.> javac Main.Java> java Main{ ""time"": ""2023-07-24T11:31:56.0000000Z"", ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"", ""rate"": 29295.929694597355}Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Understanding the Response​CoinAPI returns data in JSON format, which we convert to a Python dictionary using response.json(). The /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint response includes:time: The timestamp of the last data update.asset_id_base: The base asset (in our case, BTC).asset_id_quote: The quote asset (in our case, USD).rate: The current exchange rate from BTC to USD.Converting Between Cryptocurrencies​The /v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD endpoint retrieves the current exchange rate of BTC to USD. Additionally, the Exchange Rates endpoint provides the flexibility to obtain exchange rates between BTC and various other assets, allowing users to access the conversion rates for multiple asset pairs involving BTC.import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : 'YOUR_API_KEY'} response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) print(response.json())Here's the response for the BTC exchange rate to various assets, e.g EUR, USD, ETH, XRP:{ ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"", ""rates"": [  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""EUR"",   ""rate"": 26371.195622912368  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""USD"",   ""rate"": 29222.332203558577  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""ETH"",   ""rate"": 15.780394091251145  },  {   ""time"": ""2023-07-24T13:00:43.0000000Z"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""XRP"",   ""rate"": 41915.164263881525  },  // ...more BTC exchange rates with various other assets...}To perform a cryptocurrency conversion from one currency to another, simply multiply the given amount by the exchange rate of the target cryptocurrency. Here's an example of converting 1.5 BTC to ETH:import requests url = 'https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC' headers = {'X-CoinAPI-Key' : ""YOUR_API_KEY""}response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) #exchange rates with BTC as base assetrates = response.json()['rates'] # finding exchange rate for ETH (quote asset)eth_rate = [x['rate'] for x in rates if x['asset_id_quote'] == 'ETH'][0] btc_amount = 1.5eth_amount = btc_amount * eth_rate # actual conversionprint(f'1.5 BTC is equivalent to {eth_amount} ETH')Below is the result of 1.5 BTC to ETH conversion:>python convert.py1.5 BTC is equivalent to 23.671802476675076 ETHThe exchange rates endpoint plays a critical role in providing real-time conversion rates for cryptocurrencies. The rate represents the conversion factor that determines the value of one unit of the base currency in terms of the target currency. It indicates how much of the target currency you would get in exchange for one unit of the base currency.For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs Best Practices​Security: never expose your API key publicly or commit it to version control. Store it in a secure and encrypted location and treat your API key as a password.Error Handling: CoinAPI can return various error codes (like 400, 403, 429) indicating issues such as invalid input or rate limit exceeding. Make sure to handle these potential errors in your code.Rate Limiting: Ensure your application gracefully handles rate limit errors by implementing retry logic. Refer to CoinAPI's Rate Limiting documentation for more details.Error Handling​Include robust error handling to account for potential issues such as network errors, API limits, or invalid responses. Here's a simple example:try: response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() # Raises a HTTPError if the status is 4xx, 5xxexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f""An Error Occured: {err}"")else: data = response.json()Rate Limiting​Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits. CoinAPI provides different request tiers based on your subscription level.print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Used""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Limit""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Remaining""))print(response.headers.get(""X-RateLimit-Request-Cost""))For more information about rate limiting check REST API Limits.API Key Security​Never expose your API key in a client-side application or a public code repository. Always keep it securely on your server.dangerOnce your API key falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to make requests within your subscription.Caching​To minimize API calls and maximize efficiency, consider implementing caching on your end.Troubleshooting​If you encounter any issues while connecting to CoinAPI, make sure to:Verify that your API key is correct.Check if you have reached the API rate limit.Confirm that you're using the right endpoint and method (GET, POST, etc.).Ensure you've installed the correct libraries and dependencies and are using a supported version of the programming language.You're now ready to use CoinAPI's API to access cryptocurrency data efficiently and effectively.

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request. For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).API calls are not equivalent to requests. To give an example, for the date 2023-01-01, you only made 85 API calls, but made a total of 10,012 requests. This is because some API calls pull more data, and every 100 of those data points are considered as 1 request. If you are under the Streamer subscription, you would be exceeding your subscription tier's daily request limit (10k daily requests) and get a 429 error (i.e too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits).How do I calculate the number of requests I'll be making for a certain query?​The limit query parameter defines the amount of items to return. If you are not using the limit query parameter, the default value will be 100. If you do use it, then every 100 output items will be counted as 1 request. For example, a request using the limit parameter with a value of 1,500 would cost 15 requests (1500/100=15).https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT/history?limit=1500&period_id=1MIN&time_start=2021-01-28&time_end=2022-01-28The minimum value for the limit parameter is 1 and the maximum is 100,000. In addition, you can check the number of requests used to generate the current HTTP response by checking your response header's x-ratelimit-request-cost. You can also check x-concurrencylimit-remaining to see your remaining requests for the day. You can also check your REST API historical daily number of requests metrics by using our Customer Portal available at https://customerportal.coinapi.io/To learn more about REST API Limits, see here: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#limitsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousI forgot my paid subscription API keyNext""Invalid API Key"" error for a newly purchased keyHow do I calculate the number of requests I'll be making for a certain query?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We are selecting and managing the data sources that are used in the calculation based on multiple factors to provide data of highest quality.Algorithm is described below:Exchange rates are produced from quotes, trades, and metadata datasets.Symbols that are not data_type = ""SPOT"" are excluded from the calculation.Symbols from the data sources that were marked by us as not legitimate are excluded from the calculation.Quotes data where the spread is outside the range of <0$; 67%> are discarded. spreadPrc = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2)The midpoint from the quote data is used as a pricing reference and it's weighted by the passive cumulative volume resting on the best prices.Volume from the trades is used to weight the midpoint prices in the VWAP24 algorithm.Midpoint data that has not been updated in the last 5 minutes and 1 second is discarded.The last 24-hour volume for each symbol is updated every 4 hours when approximately 20% of the data in the sliding window changes (also, the list of eligible markets is updated at the same time).Everywhere in the algorithm below, we are using asset pairs only from exchanges that have the highest legitimacy rank, and the rest of the exchanges are discarded. As we establish the highest-ranking exchanges that have this data for each asset pair, we ensure that the highest quality data is used for each of them. The rank used for asset pairing is carried over to the following steps.Every 1 second, we update VWAP24 data for every asset pair across all data sources.For each asset pair, we also discard data that is outside the 3 sigma range if there are at least 3 exchanges for this asset pair.From the VWAP24 data, we are creating a tree structure where node/vertex = asset and edge = rate.By traversing the tree structure using the BFS algorithm and our secret sauce, we are able to establish the final exchange rates.📄️ Get all current ratesGet the current exchange rate between requested asset and all other assets.📄️ Timeseries dataGet the historical exchange rates between two assets in the form of the timeseries.📄️ Timeseries periodsYou can also obtain historical exchange rates of any asset pair, grouped into time periods.📄️ Get specific rateRetrieves the exchange rate for a specific base and quote asset at a given time or the current rate.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousREST APINext Get all current ratesCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

This means for example that BTC/USD component of the rate could be composed of the BTC/ETH * ETH/USDT * USDT/USD crosses. In this rate type, we want to express the true value of the asset by seeking markets that have volume/activity and not blinding ourselves only to the direct crosses that in the crypto industry will often not represent the majority of the price discovery activity.

""BTC/USD 1 / (USDC/USD) = BTC/USD USD/USDC = BTC/USDC""Reconnect IN​Reconnect message is sent by the server to all connected clients when the server will be restarted or shut down at the defined exact time included in the message content. After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""reconnect"" ""within_seconds"": 10, ""before_time"": ""2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z"",}Message variables​VariableDescriptiontypeMessage type, always reconnectwithin_secondsSeconds within which reconnection should be performed.before_timeTime before which reconnection should be performed.Heartbeat IN​Heartbeat message JSON is structured like this:{ ""type"": ""hearbeat""}Heartbeat message is sent to you every time there is one second of silence in communication between us, if you agreed on this feature in Hello message.tipWebSocket working on TCP protocol which doesn’t have the feature indicating that the connection is broken without trying exchange data over it. As you will not be actively sending messages to us, with Heartbeat you can distinguish a situation where there are no market data updates for you (Heartbeat is delivered but no market data updates) or connection between us is broken (Heartbeat and market data updates are not delivered).

Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?​CoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission​CoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio​CoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is handy for researchers who are not very familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers can access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?​CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don’t need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create a virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation. Clients can get all of their crypto APIs in one place, which makes it easier to manage large-scale crypto operations, trading, and data access.Still uncertain about how CoinAPI can help your business?

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Output data format​By default we are using JSON output data format for all of our endpoints, you can control format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters.URL Parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptionoutput_formatstringOutput data format (optional, default value is json, possible values are json, xml or csv)csv_include_headerboolIgnore header line in CSV output?

Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

It allows for efficient and straightforward communication between a client and a server over various transport protocols. JSON-RPC is widely used in web services and APIs due to its simplicity and ease of use.JSON-RPC 2.0 Standard​Before diving into the details of using JSON-RPC with the Market Data API, it's important to understand the JSON-RPC standard. You can find detailed information about the JSON-RPC specification on the official JSON-RPC website.Endpoint​To access market data using JSON-RPC, you need to use following URL:EnviromentEncryptionValueProductionYeshttps://rest.coinapi.io/jsonrpcAuthentication​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.Examples​Here are a few examples demonstrating how the Market Data API is accessed through JSON-RPC, along with their corresponding responses.Get exchanges​Requesthttps://rest.coinapi.io/jsonrpc?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""method"": ""v1/exchanges"", ""params"": [], ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Response{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""result"": [  {   ""exchange_id"": ""BINANCE"",   ""website"": ""https://www.binance.com/"",   ""name"": ""Binance"",   ""data_quote_start"": ""2017-12-18T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_quote_end"": ""2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_orderbook_start"": ""2017-12-18T21:50:58.3910192Z"",   ""data_orderbook_end"": ""2023-07-07T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_trade_start"": ""2017-07-14T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_trade_end"": ""2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_symbols_count"": 2349,   ""volume_1hrs_usd"": 484530018.57,   ""volume_1day_usd"": 7696242910.91,   ""volume_1mth_usd"": 227749609430.91  },  //other result entries ], ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Get BTC exchange rates​Requesthttps://rest.coinapi.io/jsonrpc/apikey-YOUR-API-KEY{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""method"": ""v1/exchangerate/BTC"", ""params"": [], ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Response{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""result"": {  ""asset_id_base"": ""BTC"",  ""rates"": [   {    ""time"": ""2023-10-31T09:19:36.0000000Z"",    ""asset_id_quote"": ""USDC"",    ""rate"": 34393.502957271553532525456547   },   //other result entries  ] }, ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Get symbols (filtered)​Requesthttps://rest.coinapi.io/jsonrpc/apikey-YOUR-API-KEY{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""method"": ""v1/symbols"", ""params"": [{""exchange_id"" : ""BITSTAMP"" }, {""filter_symbol_id"" : ""BITSTAMP_""}, {""filter_asset_id"" : ""XRP""}], ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Response{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""result"": [  {   ""symbol_id"": ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_XRP_EUR"",   ""exchange_id"": ""BITSTAMP"",   ""symbol_type"": ""SPOT"",   ""asset_id_base"": ""XRP"",   ""asset_id_quote"": ""EUR"",   ""data_start"": ""2017-01-25"",   ""data_end"": ""2023-10-30"",   ""data_quote_start"": ""2017-01-26T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_quote_end"": ""2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_orderbook_start"": ""2017-01-25T19:41:55.0000000Z"",   ""data_orderbook_end"": ""2023-07-06T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_trade_start"": ""2017-01-25T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""data_trade_end"": ""2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000Z"",   ""volume_1hrs"": 8781306.97576001,   ""volume_1hrs_usd"": 5031705.13,   ""volume_1day"": 35365544.1431782,   ""volume_1day_usd"": 20264522.16,   ""volume_1mth"": 929524888.659593,   ""volume_1mth_usd"": 532619479.27,   ""price"": 0.538365,   ""symbol_id_exchange"": ""XRPEUR"",   ""asset_id_base_exchange"": ""XRP"",   ""asset_id_quote_exchange"": ""EUR"",   ""price_precision"": 0.000010000,   ""size_precision"": 0.000000010  },  //other result entries ], ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001""}Error Responses​An incorrectly defined request may result in the following error response:{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001"" ""error"": {  ""code"": 400,  ""message"": ""Bad request (failed to parse json rpc)"" }}If a resource is not found, you can expect the following error response:{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""id"": ""my-tracking-id-001"" ""error"": {  ""code"": 404,  ""message"": ""Resource not found"" }}Was this section helpful?12345PreviousS3 APINextEMS APIIntroductionJSON-RPCJSON-RPC 2.0 StandardEndpointAuthenticationExamplesError ResponsesCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We will explore using the WebSocket protocol in Python, JavaScript, and Java to get live market data updates.Understanding WebSocket Protocol​CoinAPI provides real-time data through the WebSocket protocol. WebSocket allows for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making it an excellent choice for live data updates. The key endpoint for real-time data is wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/. To subscribe to a specific type of data, you need to send a subscription message after the connection is established.Python Example​In Python, we can use the websocket-client library to connect to CoinAPI's WebSocket API. If you don't have the websocket-client library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install websocket-clientHere's an example of real time trade data retrieval:import websocketimport json def on_message(ws, message): print(message) def on_error(ws, error): print(error) def on_close(ws): print(""### closed ###"") def on_open(ws): ws.send(json.dumps({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_USD$"" ] })) ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1"",        on_message = on_message,        on_error = on_error,        on_close = on_close)ws.on_open = on_openws.run_forever()This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real-time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesNote: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then the exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript Example​Make sure to install nodejs runtime environment before. First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""ws"": ""^8.13.0"" }}In JavaScript, you can use WebSocket API:import WebSocket from 'ws';const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/'); socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [ ""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"" ] }));}; socket.onmessage = function (event) { console.log(event.data);}; socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};This script:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real-time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesInstall dependencies via npm install command. Execute your program in nodejs runtime environment with node your-script-name.js command.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then the exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.JavaScript in a web browser​Here's an example that works directly in a web browser, create index.html file, paste the code, and start in a web browser:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <title>Realtime Crypto Market Data Example</title></head><body> <script>  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };  socket.onmessage = function (event) {   console.log(event.data);   const contentDiv = document.getElementById('content');   contentDiv.textContent += event.data;  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  }; </script>  <div id=""content""> </body></html>Java Example​If you're using a Maven project, include Java-WebSocket and JSON dependencies in your pom.xml file:<dependencies> <dependency>  <groupId>org.java-websocket</groupId>  <artifactId>Java-WebSocket</artifactId>  <version>1.5.1</version> </dependency> <dependency>  <groupId>org.json</groupId>  <artifactId>json</artifactId>  <version>20210307</version> </dependency> </dependencies>Here's a Java example that uses WebSocketClient and JSONObject classes:import org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;import org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;import org.json.JSONArray;import org.json.JSONObject;import java.net.URI;import java.net.URISyntaxException;public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) {  try {   WebSocketClient socket = new WebSocketClient(new URI(""wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/"")) {        @Override    public void onOpen(ServerHandshake serverHandshake) {     JSONObject message = new JSONObject();     message.put(""type"", ""hello"");     message.put(""apikey"", ""YOUR_API_KEY"");     JSONArray subscribeDataType = new JSONArray();     subscribeDataType.put(""trade"");     message.put(""subscribe_data_type"", subscribeDataType);     JSONArray subscribeFilterSymbolId = new JSONArray();     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"");     subscribeFilterSymbolId.put(""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$"");     message.put(""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"", subscribeFilterSymbolId);     this.send(message.toString());    }    @Override    public void onMessage(String message) {     System.out.println(message);    }    @Override    public void onClose(int code, String reason, boolean remote) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket closed"");    }    @Override    public void onError(Exception ex) {     System.out.println(""WebSocket error: "" + ex.getMessage());    }   };   socket.connect();  } catch (URISyntaxException e) {   e.printStackTrace();  } }}This Java program:Opens WebSocket connectionSubscribes to real-time data for BTC/USD trading on Bitstamp and Bitfinex (you may replace with your desired cryptocurrency pair)Prints incoming real-time messagesBest Practices​Handle connection issues: internet connections aren't always stable. Implement reconnection logic for robustness.Handle rate limiting: even for WebSocket connections, CoinAPI has rate limits. Keep track of your message rate.Secure your API Key: do not hardcode your API key. Make sure it is kept secure, consider using environment variables or secure config files which are not committed to your version control system.Note: If subscribe_filter_symbol_id is ended with $ character then the exact match is used instead of prefix match.You can check out more message examples and hello message parameters.Troubleshooting​If you're having issues, double-check the following:The API key is correct and has the required permissions.The WebSocket endpoint URL is correctly formatted.The subscription message contains a valid symbol_id.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.Stay tuned for more tutorials on advanced uses of CoinAPI!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousReal-time data visualization with javascriptNextRetrieve and analyze crypto order book data using a cryptocurrency APIIntroductionUnderstanding WebSocket ProtocolPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJavaScript in a web browserJava ExampleBest PracticesTroubleshootingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Some data sources publish order books and separately quote data (without the sizes) at a higher frequency. In that case, we will merge the order book feed with quotes feed to make sure that our updates are as fast as possible. The quotes will have the size equal to 0 as the value is unknown and the customer can decide if these higher frequency updates without the sizes are valuable or if not then can discard them or ask for at least 2 order book levels (in case of a REST API call).

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

The order may be cancelled up until the the auction locks, after which cancel requests will be rejected.INDICATION_OF_INTERESTIOIAn indication of interest (IOI) instructs exchange that this order should be processed as request for liquidity from block trading market markets.MAKER_OR_CANCELMOCA Maker or cancel (MOC) instructs exchange that this order will only add liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order could be filled immediately, the whole order will instead be rejected before any execution occurs. This instruction is also known as Post only or Participate don't initiate.CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTCODCancel on System Failure (Cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_CANCEL_ON_DISCONNECTNCODReinstate on System Failure (Do not cancel on disconnect)DO_NOT_INCREASEDNI(Reduce only) If part of a position is closed by any other means than the reduce-only order, the reduce-only order will be automatically adjusted downwards.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

In this section, we will delve into the various metric parameters, offering detailed explanations and corresponding descriptions to better understand your historical usage.What is Usage Metric?​Usage metric is record that we log when from our perspective usage of our products occured. We will name here few examples of the usage:Performing API calls, connections, subscriptions or other operations against our APIReceiving or sending data to us in various forms (flat files, streaming, API calls)Having active API Keys or defined accountsMetric parameters​Each metric can contain any amount of parameters and a single value. Parameters are used to identify where the usage occured. For example we will use parameters to separate the usage by API Key, Protocol or the Product that was accessed. Below we will list complete list of the parameters that can occur:ParameterDescriptionAPIKeyAPI Key that initiated specific usage metricDataCenterLocation where the usage metric was created (e.g. AWS-EU-EAST-1 etc)DataSourceIdentification of the specific data source which was related to usage metric (e.g. BINANCE, COINBASE, ETHEREUM-MAINNET etc.)OperationNameThe ID which identifies the operations within the ServiceName and ProtocolName, usually Data Type (DTO) otherwise id of the operation like method in the JSON-PRC calls. (e.g. QUOTES_SYMBOL_HISTORY, eth_call)ProtocolNameThe name of the protocol that was used to generate the metric (e.g. REST, WebSocket, FIX, S3)ServiceNameThe name of the product (e.g. MarketData)Grouping data​In the customer portal you can group the metrics by any parameter to inspect the usage in that dimension. For example by selecting metric COINAPI_DATA_MSGS_SENT and grouping by ProtocolName you can inspect how much bytes we delivered to your application by every protocol in requested time period.Metrics​MetricParametersUnitValue RepresentationCOINAPI_DATA_MSGS_SENTAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameEntitiesAmount of the data points/entities/messages sent by the API to the client.COINAPI_DATA_BYTES_SENTAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameBytesNumber of bytes sent by the API to the client.COINAPI_DATA_MSGS_RECEIVEDAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameEntitiesAmount of the data points/entities/messages received by the API from the customer.COINAPI_DATA_BYTES_RECEIVEDAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameBytesNumber of bytes received by the API from the customer.COINAPI_CALLS_RECEIVEDAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameCallsNumber of API calls received from client by the API.COINAPI_CALLS_SENTAPIKey DataSource OperationName ProtocolName ServiceNameCallsNumber of API calls delivered from API to client.COINAPI_REST_CREDITSAPIKey ServiceNameCreditsNumber of credits used by the API calls.

Welcome | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogWelcomeOn this pageWelcomeWelcome to the CoinAPI documentation section. This is the perfect destination to explore CoinAPI's API collection, which includes tutorials, an overview, features, use cases we cover, and much more. You've come to the perfect place whether you have questions or simply want to learn more. Our documentation area serves as a valuable resource for understanding our API and how to make the most of its features.What is CoinAPI?​CoinAPI is a collection of cryptocurrency APIs that allows users to get the most out of cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI creates the most accessible and developer-friendly APIs for the world's software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. CoinAPI streamlines crypto operations, trading, and data access on a large scale. It is the most popular option on the market due to its extensive documentation, minimal latency, simple integration, developer assistance, and SDK in a variety of languages. CoinAPI was created to make the crypto experience simpler for crypto developers, traders, and any other individuals invested in the crypto space. Customers choose CoinAPI because of our 5 years of proven experience, reliable and verified platform, service functions, and the highest frequency and aggregated data.Our mission​CoinAPI's goal is to provide all necessary APIs in one place. It eliminates the need to choose between various market vendors, making it easier for crypto users to access the data and tools they need for their use cases. Furthermore, CoinAPI helps users save time and resources, giving them more opportunities to use crypto APIs effectively. By providing a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency needs, CoinAPI is making it easier than ever to unlock the full potential of digital currencies.CoinAPI product portfolio​CoinAPI's product portfolio includes Market data API, EMS trading API, and CryptoTick, a pay-per-service platform that is handy for researchers who are not very familiar with APIs. Market data API - CoinAPI is collecting an extensive amount of market data points, enabling users to gain useful insights. Our crypto raw data can be accessed by both individuals and businesses, allowing them to create innovative services. Thanks to CoinAPI, customers can access a wide variety of cryptocurrency historical and real-time data with ease. Many customers have expressed their appreciation for our services, calling it ""never easier to organize and analyze the data."" We guarantee reliable access to all sorts of cryptocurrency data.EMS Trading API - EMS Trading API makes it possible for clients to access multiple cryptocurrency exchanges from a single account, providing the most advantageous prices available. This API allows for the connection of up to 45 different accounts, enabling trading operations and recording the history of those operations. It is possible to trade on various exchanges with the API and it provides a way to connect to exchanges and execute orders, either through REST or WebSocket API. As an example, one client has access to 1000 accounts and they can do things like view orders, and funds, and create new orders through the API.CryptoTick - CryptoTick offers a ""pay as you go"" service, where customers pay for the exact usage of the service rather than a subscription. Customers can pre-purchase a certain amount of units and can use the service until their balance runs out, after which they can top up again. CryptoTick does not have an application programming interface (API), which allows applications to integrate. Instead, customers can go directly to the site to get the requested information; they just need to specify what they require, and the data will then be provided to them. Therefore, CryptoTick is an ideal solution for customers needing historical data, as it is a user interface and not an application.Why choose CoinAPI?​CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets:API access to real-time and historical market data. CoinAPI gives access to both historical and current market information. It supplies customers with the most current quotes and trades and presents them in real time, allowing them to incorporate the data into crypto projects. Low latency and high quality. Quick response times and superior accuracy. Human experts double-check stock symbols and asset codes to guarantee accuracy. Every interface you need. We deliver three different protocols: REST, FIX, and WebSocket, so you don’t need to worry about what interface each exchange has, and what it supports. CoinAPI is integrated with almost all exchanges. CoinAPI boasts a wide-reaching integration with up to 350 exchanges, enabling users to access comprehensive data such as order books, transactions, quotes, and metadata. Furthermore, our platform aggregates this information to generate metrics and metadata from different exchanges and interprets the data to create an understanding of it across exchanges. Additionally, we archive all the data to provide our users with access to the exchanges and the data they contain.Redundancy. It's important to consider redundancy when selecting a dependable API partner, to make sure they provide server redundancy. This means that customers can access their nearest region by default, and in the case of any issues, a redundant region is automatically and immediately available. Developer-friendly interfaces. SDK in 40 languages. CoinAPI has you covered with multi-language SDKs and great documentation tailored to every endpoint. Our Software Development Kit (SDK) is available on GitHub at https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdkCreate multiple API Keys for the subscription to create a virtual space used to safely test, train, and experiment with changes or configurations to a system. It allows users to replicate their production environment and make modifications without the risk of disrupting their current operations. This is an invaluable tool for exploring new features and troubleshooting potential issues.Data standardization. By standardizing data collection via CoinAPI, you are one step closer to having a complete and clean crypto data view that you can use.Order books of the highest quality. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price in the market. Moreover, they guarantee immediate execution but do not guarantee a specific price.OHLCV data. With CoinAPI you can retrieve Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data, historical quotes, and historical trades. You can easily specify the type of data you want to retrieve using query parameters. Companies can gain a range of advantages from CoinAPI, such as gaining essential information, straightforward integration, and automation. Clients can get all of their crypto APIs in one place, which makes it easier to manage large-scale crypto operations, trading, and data access.Still uncertain about how CoinAPI can help your business?

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Output data format​By default we are using JSON output data format for all of our endpoints, you can control format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters.URL Parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptionoutput_formatstringOutput data format (optional, default value is json, possible values are json, xml or csv)csv_include_headerboolIgnore header line in CSV output? (optional, default value is true, true to include CSV header line, false otherwise)csv_include_quotesboolEncapsulate strings with quotes in CSV output? (optional, default value is false, true to encapsulate all strings with "", false to leave them unquoted)csv_exclude_colstringComma delimited list of column names to ignore in CSV output (optional, by default all columns are included)csv_set_delimiterstringCharacter that will be used as column delimiter in CSV output (optional, default value is ;)csv_set_dec_markstringCharacter that will be used as decimal separator in CSV output (optional, default value is .)csv_set_timeformatstringFormat for datetime type in CSV output or unix for unix timestamp (optional, default value is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ)csv_set_newlinestringNew line type (optional, default value is unix, possible values win, mac, unix)Excel / G-Sheets​There are several ways to use data from our REST API inside the Excel, Google Sheets, or similar calculation sheet application. This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

More information about the specific limits on each plan you can find on our Pricing page [1] and API Documentation [2].What are the risks of having multiple concurrent connections for Websocket?  Currently, subscriptions have a soft limit of a single concurrent connection for Websocket. If you are using multiple concurrent connections, the risk is in the fact that the credentials are shared between environments, and this could lead to misuse of the key or leakage affecting the production environment. If the key is misused, it could trigger some of the hard limits regarding concurrency that could affect the production.References:[1] https://www.coinapi.io/Pricing [2] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/websocket/general#limitsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousI received a reconnect message from WebsocketNextWhat are the time periods I can use for Exchange Rates and OHLCV?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

EMS - Starter Guide | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APISelf Hosted GuideREST APIWebSocket APIFIX APIEMS - Managed Cloud REST APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogEMS APIOn this pageEMS - Starter GuideThis section will provide general information about the Execution Management System API (EMS API) software product and enumerate a number of features that it provides.infoThe keywords ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.What is EMS API?​Execution Management System (EMS) is a software that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward manner. An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

This is because our Exchange Rates data is produced from Quotes, Trades, and Metadata datasets. Quotes and Trades data are symbol-based (e.g BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT), and some assets may not have symbols available yet for the queried period.For example, the asset CVX was supported starting from 2020-05-05, but it returns zero price data from 2020-05-05 to 2021-06-06. If you check the symbols for the CVX asset with the v1/symbols endpoint, most of them start only in the year 2021. Exchange rates in this case works as intended. That is why there is no Exchange Rates data for this asset for this period.To learn more about the algorithm for Exchange Rates, we have a comprehensive explanation in our documentation here: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/exchange-ratesWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhy are limit headers not always showing on a request?NextWhy do some symbols have additional prefix?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

The key is needed to authenticate your application requests. Follow the instructions provided in CoinAPI's Getting Started Guide to set up your account.Setting Up Your React App​Begin by creating a new React application. You can do this using the create-react-app command or your preferred method. npx create-react-app coinapi-portfolio-tracker-appYou should have the following project structure:Get into the root of the folder in which package.json resides and check whether the project is compiling & starting:npm startOnce your app structure is ready and the project successfully compiles, open the App.js file. Copy and paste the following code into the App.js to see the header displaying ""CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App"".import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() { return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Start the application again using npm start:Retrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPI​CoinAPI provides the v1/exchangerate/asset_id_base endpoint for fetching the latest exchange rates of your assets. To request BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and XRP/USD exchange rates from CoinAPI, we'll use useEffect hook and axios module to retrieve data. This hook will fetch the exchange rates when the component mounts and then update the portfolio state. Add the following code as part of the App.js:import React, { useState } from 'react';function App() {const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]);useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1> </div> );}export default App;Note: Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key you have obtained via the CoinAPI website.To make exchange rates appear in your web app, update the return part with the following code:return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );Here's the complete App.js code:import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <ul>  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset}>{asset}: {exchangeRate}</li>  ))}  </ul> </div> );}export default App;Before starting the application, make sure to install the axios module via the npm install axios command. Then start the application with npm start and check out the result:Styling Your Portfolio Tracker​Having fetched your portfolio data, you can now proceed to style your tracker. You can use raw CSS or opt for a UI library like Bootstrap or Material UI to enhance the look of your portfolio tracker. Here we'll use a CSS styling approach and the following classes: portfolio, portfolio-item, asset-name and asset-rate. Extend GUI part with className attributes values as following: return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );then update index.css with CSS class implementation:.portfolio { padding: 1em;}.portfolio-item { display: flex; align-items: center; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;}.asset-name { font-weight: bold; margin-right: 10px; color: #007bff;}.asset-rate { color: #28a745;}.portfolio-item:hover { transform: scale(0.95); transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;}Retrieve data at regular intervals​Rather than repeatedly refreshing the application to obtain the most recent exchange rates, we can enhance it to fetch this data at specified intervals and automatically update the view. To update the exchange rates every 5 seconds, you can use the setInterval function in React.import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function App() { const [portfolio, setPortfolio] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchExchangeRates() {  const assets = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'];  const promises = assets.map(asset =>  axios.get(`https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/${asset}/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`)  );  const responses = await Promise.all(promises);  const exchangeRates = responses.reduce((acc, response, index) => {  acc[assets[index]] = response.data.rate;  return acc;  }, {});  setPortfolio(exchangeRates); } fetchExchangeRates(); // Fetch exchange rates every 5 seconds const intervalId = setInterval(fetchExchangeRates, 5000); // Clean up the interval when the component unmounts to avoid memory leaks return () => clearInterval(intervalId); }, []); return ( <div className=""App"">  <h1>CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker App</h1>  <div className=""portfolio"">  {Object.entries(portfolio).map(([asset, exchangeRate]) => (   <li key={asset} className=""portfolio-item"">   <span className=""asset-name"">{asset}/USD:</span>    <span className=""asset-rate"">{exchangeRate}</span>   </li>  ))}  </div> </div> );}export default App;By following these steps, you'll create a basic cryptocurrency portfolio tracker using React and CoinAPI. For more information, you can check REST API Exchange Rates docs If you would like the data to be sent to you in real-time, check our Real-time data visualization with javascript or real-time trades stream using WebSocket with different languages ""how-to"" articles.Happy coding!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousAcquire exchange rates with different programming languagesNextCreating a historical crypto price chart using CoinAPI and D3.jsGetting Started with CoinAPISetting Up Your React AppRetrieving Your Portfolio Data from CoinAPIStyling Your Portfolio TrackerRetrieve data at regular intervalsCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Its capabilities encompass data preprocessing, transformation, analysis, machine learning, and visualization, making it versatile for a wide range of data-related tasks. By seamlessly integrating with our REST API, you gain the ability to fetch comprehensive market data, providing you with the power to conduct in-depth research, formulate effective trading strategies, manage portfolios, and make informed, data-driven decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.Prerequisites​A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website)Installed KNIME Analytics Platform Creating KNIME workflow to get BTC exchange rates​If you have properly installed KNIME on your computer and obtained the CoinAPI key, we can start by preparing a workflow. Workflow refers to the visual representation of a data analysis process. It typically consists of nodes (also known as steps or tasks) connected in a specific sequence, where each node performs a specific operation on the data.Here's an example of two nodes connected:Get Request (sends an HTTP GET request to a specified URL, typically an API endpoint like rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC)Output JSON (receives the JSON data obtained from the API response and presents it in a structured format)Using this example, you can download data and view it within the Output JSON block.Each node result may be easily previewed:Here's an output of the Get Request node:Here's an output of the Output JSON node:Configuring GET Request in KNIME​To configure a GET Request block, click Configure:In the Connection Settings tab, enter the URL of the resource you want to retrieve, e.g https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC:In the Request Headers tab, enter the X-CoinAPI-Key header with the API key you have obtained via the website.Summary​Simple but also more complex workflows can be designed, enabling advanced operations like filtering, grouping, and utilizing your own Python scripts, culminating in the option to save the processed data in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or others. KNIME together with our Market Data API allows users to analyze market finance data for tasks like machine learning, data analysis, generating charts, optimizing portfolios, managing risks, backtesting trading strategies, and more.Embrace the world of market data analysis!Was this section helpful?12345PreviousCreating a historical crypto price chart using CoinAPI and D3.jsNextGet Historical OHLCV Data Using CoinAPIIntroductionPrerequisitesCreating KNIME workflow to get BTC exchange ratesConfiguring GET Request in KNIMESummaryCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Output data format​By default we are using JSON output data format for all of our endpoints, you can control format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters.URL Parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptionoutput_formatstringOutput data format (optional, default value is json, possible values are json, xml or csv)csv_include_headerboolIgnore header line in CSV output? (optional, default value is true, true to include CSV header line, false otherwise)csv_include_quotesboolEncapsulate strings with quotes in CSV output? (optional, default value is false, true to encapsulate all strings with "", false to leave them unquoted)csv_exclude_colstringComma delimited list of column names to ignore in CSV output (optional, by default all columns are included)csv_set_delimiterstringCharacter that will be used as column delimiter in CSV output (optional, default value is ;)csv_set_dec_markstringCharacter that will be used as decimal separator in CSV output (optional, default value is .)csv_set_timeformatstringFormat for datetime type in CSV output or unix for unix timestamp (optional, default value is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ)csv_set_newlinestringNew line type (optional, default value is unix, possible values win, mac, unix)Excel / G-Sheets​There are several ways to use data from our REST API inside the Excel, Google Sheets, or similar calculation sheet application. This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

CoinAPI is your one-stop solution for cryptocurrency data. We offer seamless access to real-time and historical financial data from hundreds of exchanges. Whether you're looking for raw trading data, OHLCV, or specific events, we've got you covered.We support multiple data delivery methods like REST, WebSocket, and more. Perfect for developers looking to build anything from trading algorithms to financial visualizations.Let's set it up 🚀​CoinAPI is your go-to platform for obtaining real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, featuring comprehensive API solutions suitable for developers and financial analysts alike. Coupled with D3.js, a javascript library for data visualization, you have the perfect toolkit for crafting sophisticated, real-time financial dashboards or trading algorithms. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to utilize CoinAPI's RESTful API in a web environment to fetch cryptocurrency data. You'll also learn how to visualize data using D3.js.Getting Started​First, create a new project folder on your computer and name it crypto_price_chart. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.Setting Up the API Request​To fetch data from CoinAPI, we'll first need to make an API request. This will require an API key, which you can obtain by registering at the CoinAPI website.Code Snippet: Prepare index.html​Here's the basic structure of a web page designed to visualize cryptocurrency closing prices over a specified period using D3.js.<!doctype html><html> <head> <title>Coinapi</title> <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js""></script> <script src=""script.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css""> </head> <h1>BTC Closing Prices Over Time</h1> <h3>(Data Period: 1 Day, Starting from January 1st, 2021, for 360 Days)</h3> <svg width=""800"" height=""600""></svg></html>Code Snippet: Fetching Data from CoinAPI​Create a function in your script.js to fetch historical data.const API_KEY = ""YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"";const url = `https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?apikey=${API_KEY}&period_id=1DAY&time_start=2021-01-01T00:00:00&limit=360`;async function fetchData() { try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) {  throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); } const data = await response.json(); return data; } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching data:', error); throw error; }}Preparing the Data​After fetching the data, it needs to be prepared for charting. We'll create a simple function to transform the data into a format that D3.js can easily interpret. Add it to the end of script.js.Code Snippet: Data Transformation​function transformData(data) { return data.map(entry => ({ date: new Date(entry.time_period_start), price: entry.price_close }));}Now let's dive into building the chart.Code Snippet: building chart with D3.js​Add this code at the end of your script.js file.document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { const svg = d3.select(""svg""); // Select the existing SVG element in the HTML fetchData() .then(data => {  const transformedData = transformData(data);  // Define chart dimensions  const width = 800;  const height = 600;  const margin = { top: 50, right: 50, bottom: 50, left: 50 };  // Create a group for the chart elements  const chartGroup = svg.append(""g"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(${margin.left}, ${margin.top})`);  // Create scales  const xScale = d3.scaleUtc()  .domain(d3.extent(transformedData, d => d.date))  .range([0, width - margin.left - margin.right]);  const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()  .domain([0, d3.max(transformedData, d => d.price)])  .range([height - margin.bottom - margin.top, 0]);  // Create a line generator  const line = d3.line()  .x(d => xScale(d.date))  .y(d => yScale(d.price));  // Draw the line  chartGroup.append(""path"")  .datum(transformedData)  .attr(""class"", ""line"")  .attr(""d"", line);  // Add axes  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""x-axis"")  .attr(""transform"", `translate(0, ${height - margin.bottom - margin.top})`)  .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale));  chartGroup.append(""g"")  .attr(""class"", ""y-axis"")  .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale)); }) .catch(error => console.log(error));});Code snippet: styling the chart​Now, let's style your chart using the provided CSS. Add the following CSS to your style.css file:body, h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li { margin: 5; padding: 0; color: white;}/* Set a gradient background for the body */body { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #080059, #6C4CFC);}/* Style the SVG container */svg { background-color: transparent; /* Transparent background for the chart */}/* Style the chart line */.line { fill: none; stroke: #6C4CFC; /* Purple color for the line */ stroke-width: 2;}/* Style the x-axis */.x-axis path,.x-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for x-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.x-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the x-axis labels */}/* Style the y-axis */.y-axis path,.y-axis line { fill: none; stroke: #ccc; /* Light gray color for y-axis lines */ shape-rendering: crispEdges;}.y-axis text { font-size: 12px; fill: white; /* Text color for the y-axis labels */}/* Style the legend */.legend { font-size: 16px; text-align: right; color: white; /* Text color for the legend text */}Testing Your Chart​Save all your files and open index.html in a web browser.

On the Enterprise Plan, it's possible to have direct access to the sites or set up AWS VPC Peering in that case latency between our infrastructure and the customer is below one millisecond. If the connection was established to the public endpoint, then it's routed using the GeoDNS to the closest site; latency then depends on the distance between the customer and the site where the connection was routed [~20ms].Was this section helpful?12345PreviousFIX API Logon TroubleshootingNextHow are exchange rates calculated?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

For example, ExchangeId and exchangeid are treated as equivalent keys.If a key and value is set in more than one configuration providers, the value from the last provider added is used.Using array indices in configuration keys are allowed.Hierarchical keysWithin the Configuration API, a colon separator (:) works on all platforms.In environment variables, a colon separator may not work on all platforms. A double underscore, __, is supported by all platforms and is automatically converted into a colon :.Configuration values:Are strings.Null values can't be stored in configuration.Configuration providers​You can set the values of configuration parameters for the components using the following providers (in case of collision for any specific key):Command-line argumentsEnvironment variablesEnvironment variables​To configure specific parameters using host or container environment variable, you must replace all occurrences of : with __ in the configuration parameter key, this is because the : separator doesn't work with environment variable hierarchical keys on all platforms. __, the double underscore, is:Supported by all platforms. For example, the : separator is not supported by Bash, but __ is.Automatically replaced by a :For example, to set the value of the configuration parameter OEML:ExchangeId to BITSTAMP you would need to set the environment variable named OMS__ExchangeId to BITSTAMP.Command-line arguments​You can set the configuration parameters by providing the arguments to the application executable.The following example sets keys and values using the =: OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP The following example sets keys and values using the /: /OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP The following example sets keys and values using the --: --OEML:ExchangeId=BITSTAMP or --OEML:ExchangeId BITSTAMPThe key value:Must follow =, or the key must have a prefix of -- or / when the value follows a space.Isn't required if = is used.

This service discovery works by the one of the following methods:Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud, every time you start CoinAPI EMS Edge, it will register automatically in our central cloud infrastructure.Using the HashiCorp Consul Cluster.Using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud is a default, simple, and straightforward method. Only one disadvantage of using the CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud over Consul Cluster is that we do not measure the latencies if one order destination is registered more than one time in the cluster for failover scenarios. Then CoinAPI EMS Central Cloud will connect to the last started exchange; however, when using the Consul Cluster, it will connect to the order destination in the closest proximity data center to the datacenter where CoinAPI EMS API is run.Running using an executable​To install the precompiled binary, download the latest version of the executable matching your system architecture from http://coinapi-releases.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Our software is currently packaged as a zip file, and we currently do not plan to distribute it another way. Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The self-contained binary inside is necessary to run EMS, and any additional files are not required to run the software.If you intend to access it from the command-line, make sure to place the binary somewhere on your PATH. You may require to add the executable to the system startup with all necessary parameters if you want the software to be started automatically after restart.Running on Docker​# example using only command line parametersdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTC \ --OD:PublicApiKey _public_api_key_ --OD:PrivateApiKey _private_api_key_ \ --CoinAPI:ApiKey _coinapi_api_key_ docker run -d --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-webuidocker run --net=host coinapi/oeml-cli# example with enviroment variables filecat > oeml.env << EOFCoinAPI__ApiKey=_coinapi_api_key_OD__PublicApiKey=_public_api_key_OD__PrivateApiKey=_private_api_key_EOFdocker run -d --name=HITBTC --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId HITBTCdocker run -d --name=BITFINEX --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.env --OEML:ExchangeId BITFINEXdocker run -d --name=OEML_EDGE --restart=always --net=host coinapi/oeml-api --env-file oeml.envOur software is listed in public docker repository. To run the software on docker, use the following images:coinapi/oeml-apicoinapi/oeml-clicoinapi/oeml-webuiTo pass the configuration parameters using the environment variables (more information about this feature is available in the Configuration Manual section of this documentation), the environment variables must be provided into the container and not set on the host machine.It's a good practice to lock itself into the specific version. To do that you can supply the version after image name and : separator, e.g. coinapi/oeml-api:1.1255Running on Kubernetes Cluster​Our software is compatible with Kubernetes, and you can quickly run it on the cluster using our (Helm Charts)[https://github.com/coinapi/helm-charts].

If the lowest latency is required, start the instance per location or server where the API will is used to minimize latency between API client and the EMS API Server.(optional) Run the CoinAPI EMS WebUI to have GUI to the cluster.Done! All the exchange accounts can be managed using the single API.Installation​CoinAPI EMS can be installed using several approaches:Running using an executableRunning on DockerRunning on Kubernetes ClusterOur software is compiled for the following architectures:linux-x64linux-arm64osx-x64osx-arm64win-x64 win-arm64Take a look at the Starter Guide of this documentation for more information how to run the software in the specific conditions.If you can't use any of those, let us know why that is a problem by creating a support case, and we will evaluate the possibility of extending compatibility.Upgrading​Currently, all components are stateless. Upgrading stateless components is limited to replacing the binaries or running the new docker image.Versioning & Compatibility​Our software is versioned using the Major.Minor(+branch) pattern. Major version number is incremented manually on our side, and its scope is for the EMS project. The Minor version number is incremented on every release automatically separately for every component.You can assume that our software components will work together when their Major version numbers are the same.Time synchronization​EMS highly depends on the current time to perform actions and correctly timestamp the data for real-time trading, risk management, compliance, or reporting.For the time synchronization we strongly recommending:chrony (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, macOS)w32tm (Windows)If you can't use any of the programs above for reasons like:Software has not been ported to my operating system.Software doesn't have a driver or it's not compatible with my hardware reference clock, and I can't use other programs like gpsd or ntp-refclock to provide reference time via the SHM or SOCK interface.Then it's worth trying solutions below (ordered from the best to worst options):ntp (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows)openntpd (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, macOS)If need the sub-millisecond or sub-nanosecond accuracy take a look there:Meinberg Radio ClocksWhite RabbitLimits​This section will list all known software limitations.Limit descriptionLimit valueMaximum number of managed exchange accounts in a single clusterUnlimitedMaximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster host when running an executable65,535Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Docker or Docker Swarm1024Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Kubernetes250Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)from 4 to 737Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)100Maximum number of managed exchange accounts per cluster node when running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)250tipThere is no limit of exchange accounts that can simultaneously be managed using our EMS API.Integrations & Plugins​This section is reserved for Integrations, plugins or other external tools or modules that make it easier to work with EMS API.Prometheus metrics​In this section, we will describe the metrics exposed by the software on the /metrics endpoint.

CoinAPI offers extensive historical data across multiple cryptocurrency markets, which is critical for backtesting trading strategies, performing quantitative research, or even creating visualizations. We will cover how to interact with our historical data endpoints using Python, JavaScript, and Java.Understanding CoinAPI Endpoints​CoinAPI provides several endpoints for accessing historical data, including:ohlcv/period_id/history: Provides historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for specified periods.trades/symbol_id/history: Returns historical trades.quotes/symbol_id/history: Provides historical quotes.Remember, you need to replace period_Id and symbol_id with your desired period and symbol respectively.Python Example​Using Python, we can use the requests library to interact with CoinAPI. If you don't have the requests library installed, you can add it using pip:pip install requestsHere's an example:import requestsdef fetch_ohlcv(): url = ""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"" headers = { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" } # Replace with your API key response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) # Check if the response is successful if response.status_code == 200:  if response.content:   return response.json()  else:   print(""Response is empty."")   return None else:  # Handle other HTTP status codes  print(f""Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}"")  return None print(fetch_ohlcv())This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.JavaScript Example​Make sure to install the nodejs runtime environment before. In JavaScript, we can use the fetch API for sending requests to CoinAPI:First, add package.json with node-fetch dependency:{ ""type"": ""module"", ""dependencies"": { ""node-fetch"": ""^3.3.1"" }}Add the following code and run npm install to install dependencies.import fetch from 'node-fetch';fetch('https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00', { headers: { ""X-CoinAPI-Key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"" // Replace with your API key }}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Java Example​In Java, we can use the HttpURLConnection class to send HTTP requests:import java.net.HttpURLConnection;import java.net.URL;import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.InputStreamReader;public class Main { private static final String API_KEY = ""YOUR-API-KEY""; // Replace with your API key public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {  URL url = new URL(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_ETH_BTC/history?period_id=1MTH&time_start=2023-03-01T00:00:00"");  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  conn.setRequestProperty(""X-CoinAPI-Key"", API_KEY);  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));  String inputLine;  StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();  while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {   content.append(inputLine);  }  in.close();  conn.disconnect();  System.out.println(content.toString()); }}This script fetches the monthly OHLCV data for the ETH/BTC trading pair from the BINANCE exchange. Here, BINANCE serves as the exchange platform, with ETH being the base asset and BTC as the quote asset.Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Best Practices​Store API keys securely: never hard-code API keys. Instead, store them in secure configuration files or environment variables.Handle rate limiting: be aware of CoinAPI's rate limits and handle 429 HTTP status codes gracefully in your application.Efficient data fetching: use query parameters like time_start and limit effectively to get the data you need without excess.Troubleshooting​In case you face any issues, ensure the following:Your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.You are not exceeding the rate limit for your account type.You are using the correct endpoint with proper request headers.The symbol and period IDs you are using are valid and in the correct format.You have the correct libraries or dependencies installed, and you're using a supported version of the language.For more information, you can check REST API OHLVC docsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousFetching market data with KNIMENextGet symbol funding rate metric data using CoinAPIIntroductionUnderstanding CoinAPI EndpointsPython ExampleJavaScript ExampleJava ExampleCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

This mechanism will still exist in the future, however, we have assigned work to remove this backward jump in this or next quarter; it's not our priority at the moment as the impact is too low and it does not affect the quality of the data.You should always process all items in the file in the order in which they are recorded in the file and never change this order.When processing items according to the file order you will have the book which you can use for further processing. The current timestamp of the book is determined by the last processed line in the flat file (timestamps on this last line). In the event when the time going backward you should still normally process the file, but you can restrict supplying the book outside the flat-file processing algorithm until flat-file book time will be greater again than maximum seen timestamp; using this algorithm you will process the backward snapshot and corresponding updates to it transparently.Take a look at the example source code that describes the algorithm above: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/blob/master/csharp-flatfiles-example/Program.csWas this section helpful?12345PreviousHow to get more than 100 items in response?NextHow to handle payment errors during sign upCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

To ensure that we promptly respond to your API calls and avoid unnecessary delays, we choose to provide a response without including the response headers. This decision is made with the intention of optimizing the operation of our API. By selectively excluding the inclusion of response headers in every request, we can enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the API.It takes a while to verify the current usage as for the very first call for a given client we do not have a rate limit then yet. Once the request is made, we start the rate limit verification process In the background. We may then in the meantime process many requests for this client and at some point we append the result of current usage to the header. All requests that were made during that process are also included in the limit after some time.For example (each bullet point representing a request made):Request (no info about clients usage)What's the usage? Starting the verificationRequestRequest5 requests used today (those 3 above are not counted yet), appended to the headerRequest (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (10 requests used today)To provide clarity and transparency regarding the absence of response headers, we have documented this behavior on our official documentation page, which can be found at https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#request-limit--apikeyWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhere can I find examples and SDK source codes for API?NextWhy are there no Exchange Rates data for some assets for a given period?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

For example, to calculate the exchange rates of BTC/USD, we also incorporate BTC/CNY, BTC/JPY, BTC/GBP, BTC/EUR.Exchanges are representing a different level of market data quality. To account for that factor our algorithm uses trustworthy exchanges first and if the data could not be produced using this set of exchanges, for example, a specific asset requested is not available on any of the trustworthy exchanges, then we are using all other exchanges to produce requested data. This approach of combining credible and less trusted data sources, giving our customers an overview of the whole market without compromising the data quality.Reference:[1] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/exchange-ratesWas this section helpful?12345PreviousGeographic locations and the LatencyNextHow can I get OHLCV data by asset pair?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example. We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Output data format​By default we are using JSON output data format for all of our endpoints, you can control format of data by using output_format variable in query string parameters.URL Parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptionoutput_formatstringOutput data format (optional, default value is json, possible values are json, xml or csv)csv_include_headerboolIgnore header line in CSV output? (optional, default value is true, true to include CSV header line, false otherwise)csv_include_quotesboolEncapsulate strings with quotes in CSV output? (optional, default value is false, true to encapsulate all strings with "", false to leave them unquoted)csv_exclude_colstringComma delimited list of column names to ignore in CSV output (optional, by default all columns are included)csv_set_delimiterstringCharacter that will be used as column delimiter in CSV output (optional, default value is ;)csv_set_dec_markstringCharacter that will be used as decimal separator in CSV output (optional, default value is .)csv_set_timeformatstringFormat for datetime type in CSV output or unix for unix timestamp (optional, default value is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ)csv_set_newlinestringNew line type (optional, default value is unix, possible values win, mac, unix)Excel / G-Sheets​There are several ways to use data from our REST API inside the Excel, Google Sheets, or similar calculation sheet application. This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA(""https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.

Authentication | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogAuthenticationOn this pageAuthenticationIn this section, you will find comprehensive information about the process of CoinAPI authentication. It covers the fundamental aspects and procedures involved in obtaining authentication for CoinAPI usage. Whether you are new to CoinAPI or seeking to enhance your understanding of the authentication process, this section will provide you with a valuable overview of the topic.There are different types of authentication methods available to secure and control access to its services.API Key - fundamental method of authentication that involves the usage of an API key for authentication and access control.API Key + JWT token - extended authentication method that combines the use of an API key along with a JWT token for enhanced security and authentication. Useful when you need to share the API Key publicly, for example when accessing the CoinAPI endpoints from the frontend JavaScript code exposed to the end-users. JWT token will be required along the API Key from the CoinAPI side to perform successful authentication, and the JWT tokens can be only generated from your side as you know the secret (private key or secret) based on which JWT token with the specified expiration time are issued.Authentication methods supported by the API​Here's an overview of the various products offered by CoinAPI and the supported authentication methods for each product. To use resources that require authorized access, you will need to use one of the many authentication methods described below.Product nameAPIX-CoinAPI-Key headerQuery paramURL pathAuthorization headerBasic authJWTTLS Client CertSenderCompIDAWS Signature Version 2/4Market DataREST✅✅✅✅✅✅❌❌❌Market DataWS✅✅✅✅✅✅❌❌❌Market DataFIX❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌Market DataS3✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅EMSManaged Cloud REST✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌EMSREST✅✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌EMSWS✅✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌EMSFIX❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌NodeJSON-RPC✅✅✅✅✅✅❌❌❌cautionIf you are using the Authorization header to pass the API key, please note that it cannot be used together with a JWT token. In case you have enabled JWT authentication, we recommend using alternative methods to pass the API key such as: a Custom authentication header, Query string parameter, or API Key in the URL.X-CoinAPI-Key header​You can authorize by providing an additional custom header named X-CoinAPI-Key and API key as its value.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, then the authentication header you should send to us will look like:X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYQuery string parameter (apikey)​You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named apikey with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.Assuming that your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY and that you want to request all exchange rates from BTC asset, then your query string should look like this: GET /v1/exchangerate/BTC?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYcautionThe Query string method may be more practical for development activities.URL path​To ensure proper authentication when passing the API key in the URL, it is important to format it correctly. The real API key should always be preceded by the APIKEY- prefix, followed by the actual API key. For example, if your API key is 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY, the URL should be structured as /APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY.The API key can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of the URL path. Note that the key is completely ignored when determining the path of the requested resource. Here are examples of the different placements:At the beginning of the URL:/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/v1/exchangesIn the middle of the URL:/v1/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY/exchangesAt the end of the URL:/v1/exchanges/APIKEY-73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYPlease make sure to replace 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY with your actual API key for authentication and access to the requested resources and remember to include the APIKEY- prefix before your real API key.Authorization header​This method involves including the API key directly in the Authorization header of the API request.Authorization: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEYBasic auth​Use Basic Authentication by setting the Authorization header with a base64 encoded string that combines your API key with a username (coinapi):Authorization: Basic Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk=In this example, Y29pbmFwaTo3MzAzNDAyMS1USElTLUlTLVNBTVBMRS1LRVk is a base64 encoded string of the username and API key (coinapi:73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY).JWT token​The JWT authentication method provides a secure and efficient way to authorize requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). With this method, JWTs can be passed via the Authorization header in the Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Supported JWT Algorithms​The JWT authentication method supports the following algorithms for JWT token verification with various key sizes:RSASSA-PSS (e.g. PS256)RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g. RS256)ECDSA (e.g. ES256)HMAC (e.g. HS256)Enabling JWT authentication​To enable JWT authentication for your API key:Access the customer portal and import the public JWT key (RSA or ECDSA) for the API key.Generate a JWT token using your private key (it ensures the authenticity and integrity of the token)Include the generated JWT token in the Authorization header of your API requests using Bearer JWT_TOKEN format.Let the CoinAPI server verify the token's authenticity using the corresponding public key you've imported in Step 1 during the API request.Example request with JWT authentication​To include a JWT in an API request, add the token to the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The format of the header is as follows: `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN`Example request header with JWT token generated using RS256 algorithm:Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5ODViMmQ0ZC1kMjE1LTQwN2MtODcxNi01NTIzNjA0YmM0ZTIiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.ew0KICAic3ViIjogIjEyMzQ1Njc4OTAiLA0KICAibmFtZSI6ICJFWEFNUExFIFRPS0VOIiwNCiAgImlhdCI6IDE1MTYyMzkwMjIsDQogICJuYmYiOiAxNjg2MTM3MDI0LA0KICAiZXhwIjogMTcxNzY3MzAyNA0KfQ.CX6MWRSXQPKuQ_jrFCME91IwZhK8lq_2XrbDOyZ4-tPo0Ro52HA289sIfLo2LNafWQlq2lClfCN55TxyfC8n0xiifUwdec7g3kcGjCri6vTxaa8p6S3Fyyt2DxXccpi3Se4d_3mEQBZwMchKbQsw-W7Wj7njUk31ycgPQovvF4WrTuEYmhYw1sO9jCTORHmsSO7Shml7kv7AxlIUmzB2oq2KSmBhJV38Nz9oYj3KlPoMjgaIl4xYldNqnGyshh6fQyUQ1gQMQV6e4M5ro8YthjPOCvAT8yk77dTyOoE6Im58cAp6KtM-Gko-tWppUQTu-0M82LOvD_duP77n-hcoTwDecoded JWT token header:{ ""kid"": ""985b2d4d-d215-407c-8716-5523604bc4e2"", ""alg"": ""RS256"" }Decoded JWT token payload:{ ""sub"": ""1234567890"", ""name"": ""EXAMPLE TOKEN"", ""iat"": 1516239022, ""nbf"": 1686137024, ""exp"": 1717673024}JWT Token expiration​To ensure the validity of JWT tokens and prevent the use of expired tokens, the inclusion of the following claims is required:NBF (Not Before)The ""nbf"" claim specifies the earliest time at which the token can be considered valid. Tokens with a ""nbf"" claim set in the future should not be accepted.EXP (Expiration Time)The ""exp"" claim defines the expiration time of the token. Tokens with an ""exp"" claim set in the past should not be accepted.Request authentication​During the process of request authentication, the CoinAPI server follows a series of steps to ensure secure access to its resources. Here's an overview of the authentication process:Upon receiving the request, the CoinAPI server extracts the JWT from the Authorization header.Then, it verifies the JWT signature and checks the ""NBF"" and ""EXP"" claims to ensure token validity and expiration.If the JWT is valid and not expired, the server authorizes the request and proceeds with the necessary processing to access CoinAPI resources.If the JWT is invalid or expired, the server returns an appropriate error response.TLS Client Cert​TLS Client Certificate acquired from the Managed Cloud REST API (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) provided while establishing a TLS session with us.SenderCompID​This method of authentication is FIX protocol-specific.

These allow for more granular control over the data streams without the need to resend the entire subscription scope as previously required with the hello message.To subscribe to additional data types or filters without overriding existing subscriptions, send a subscribe message:Example subscribe message for book data related to ""BTC"" and ""ETH"":{ ""type"": ""subscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC"", ""ETH""]}This message adds subscriptions to the specified data types and filters, augmenting any existing subscriptions maintained in the session.Unsubscribe OUT​Similarly, to remove specific data types or filters from your current subscription, send an unsubscribe message:Example unsubscribe message to remove book data subscription for ""BTC"":{ ""type"": ""unsubscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC""]}The unsubscribe message removes the specified subscriptions without affecting other existing subscriptions.Subscribe vs Hello​In the realm of subscription management, three key actions allow you to fine-tune your information feed according to evolving requirements:Subscribe: This action expands your current subscription scope by adding new elements without discarding any existing ones. It's particularly useful for tailoring your feed as your interests or information needs grow.Unsubscribe: Through this option, you can selectively remove specific elements from your current subscription. It's an efficient way to declutter your feed by eliminating content that no longer serves your needs, without affecting the rest of your subscriptions.Hello: Use this command to initiate a fresh start. It clears your existing subscription slate and sets up a new scope from scratch. Opt for this when a complete overhaul of your subscriptions is needed, rather than just an adjustment.After your WebSocket connection is established, you must send us a hello or subscribe message which contains:Stream preferences (Heartbeat and subscription details)API key for authorizationIf your message will be incorrect, we will send you error message and disconnect connection afterwards.Hello message can be repeated, each one will cause subscription scope override without interruption of your WebSocket connection.Message parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptiontypestringMessage type, must be equal to one of the values: hello, subscribe or unsubscribeapikeystringYour API keyheartbeatbooltrue to receive Heartbeat message every second, otherwise falsesubscribe_data_typestring[]List of data types you want to receive (required, possible values listed in table below)subscribe_filter_symbol_idstring[]Filter data to symbols whose identifiers match at least one of the listed prefixes.

If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTSubscribe OUTUnsubscribe OUTSubscribe vs HelloMessage parametersData typesError handlingData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

We'll use Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for data visualization.Prerequisites​Basic understanding of JavaScript and WebSockets.A CoinAPI key (obtainable by signing up on the CoinAPI website).Familiarity with Chart.js (Visit the Chart.js documentation for more information).Visualizing Data with Chart.js​First, we'll create an empty chart using Chart.js. <!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we'll establish ws connection and update the chart with real-time data **/ </script></body></html>The script creates a new line chart with an empty dataset. We'll fill in the data as we receive it from the WebSocket connection in the next step.Setting Up the WebSocket Connection​We need to set up a WebSocket connection to CoinAPI and update the chart: /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update the chart with real-time data **/const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');socket.onopen = function (event) { socket.send(JSON.stringify({  ""type"": ""hello"",  ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",  ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],  ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""] }));};socket.onmessage = function (event) {    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);    // Add new data to the chart  chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);  chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);    // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50  if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {   chart.data.labels.shift();   chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();  }    // Update the chart  chart.update();};socket.onerror = function (error) { console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);};Note: Don't forget to replace YOUR-API-KEY with your actual API key.Here's the complete code:<!DOCTYPE html><html><head> <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js""></script> <title>Visualizing Data with Chart.js</title></head><body> <canvas id=""myChart""></canvas> <script>  /** part1: chart initialization **/  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');  const chart = new Chart(ctx, {   type: 'line',   data: {    labels: [], // This will be populated with timestamps    datasets: [{     data: [], // This will be populated with trade prices     label: 'BTC/USD',     borderColor: '#3e95cd',     fill: false    }]   },   options: {    title: {     display: true,     text: 'Real-Time BTC/USD Trade Prices'    }   }  });    /** part2: below we establish ws connection and update the chart with real time data **/  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.coinapi.io/v1/');  socket.onopen = function (event) {   socket.send(JSON.stringify({    ""type"": ""hello"",    ""apikey"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",    ""subscribe_data_type"": [""trade""],    ""subscribe_filter_symbol_id"": [""BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD$"", ""BITFINEX_SPOT_BTC_LTC$""]   }));  };    socket.onmessage = function (event) {        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);        // Add new data to the chart    chart.data.labels.push(data.time_exchange);    chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.price);        // Remove the oldest data point if there are more than 50    if (chart.data.labels.length > 50) {     chart.data.labels.shift();     chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();    }        // Update the chart    chart.update();  };  socket.onerror = function (error) {   console.log(`WebSocket error: ${error}`);  };   </script></body></html>The onmessage event is activated whenever a new message (in our case, trade data) is received from the server. The message data is in JSON format, which we convert to a JavaScript object with JSON.parse().Our chart now updates in real time as we receive trade data from CoinAPI!You're now equipped to use CoinAPI with JavaScript for real-time data visualization.

REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests. This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%. This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API, as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{ ""error"": ""Invalid API key""}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example.

These allow for more granular control over the data streams without the need to resend the entire subscription scope as previously required with the hello message.To subscribe to additional data types or filters without overriding existing subscriptions, send a subscribe message:Example subscribe message for book data related to ""BTC"" and ""ETH"":{ ""type"": ""subscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC"", ""ETH""]}This message adds subscriptions to the specified data types and filters, augmenting any existing subscriptions maintained in the session.Unsubscribe OUT​Similarly, to remove specific data types or filters from your current subscription, send an unsubscribe message:Example unsubscribe message to remove book data subscription for ""BTC"":{ ""type"": ""unsubscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC""]}The unsubscribe message removes the specified subscriptions without affecting other existing subscriptions.Subscribe vs Hello​In the realm of subscription management, three key actions allow you to fine-tune your information feed according to evolving requirements:Subscribe: This action expands your current subscription scope by adding new elements without discarding any existing ones. It's particularly useful for tailoring your feed as your interests or information needs grow.Unsubscribe: Through this option, you can selectively remove specific elements from your current subscription. It's an efficient way to declutter your feed by eliminating content that no longer serves your needs, without affecting the rest of your subscriptions.Hello: Use this command to initiate a fresh start. It clears your existing subscription slate and sets up a new scope from scratch. Opt for this when a complete overhaul of your subscriptions is needed, rather than just an adjustment.After your WebSocket connection is established, you must send us a hello or subscribe message which contains:Stream preferences (Heartbeat and subscription details)API key for authorizationIf your message will be incorrect, we will send you error message and disconnect connection afterwards.Hello message can be repeated, each one will cause subscription scope override without interruption of your WebSocket connection.Message parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptiontypestringMessage type, must be equal to one of the values: hello, subscribe or unsubscribeapikeystringYour API keyheartbeatbooltrue to receive Heartbeat message every second, otherwise falsesubscribe_data_typestring[]List of data types you want to receive (required, possible values listed in table below)subscribe_filter_symbol_idstring[]Filter data to symbols whose identifiers match at least one of the listed prefixes.

If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume).

An EMS allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).The software can be used in 2 different ways:Managed Cloud - Everything on our side. Hosted in the Cloud by CoinAPI. You manage the deployment using the REST API.Self-Hosted - Software on our side, on everything else.Dimension ComparisonManaged CloudSelf-HostedEase of use/installationVery easyHardTime to marketFastSlowDevOps team required to maintainNoYesOrder flow sent directly to the destinationNoYesWho manages the infrastructure (incl. monitoring)CoinAPIYouWho optimizes the latencyCoinAPIYou (CoinAPI only in software)How to installInstruct our Cloud Mgmt APIInstall on your infrastructurecautionWe recommend starting with the Managed Cloud and possibly upgrading to the Self-Hosted if the requirements of the integration/project will make that commercially reasonable.Architecture and components​A self-hosted EMS cluster can be deployed on a single server or multiple servers that will span multiple geographical locations, server sites, or cloud providers. In the Managed Cloud version, you did not care about that as we manage the server sites to be as close to the order destinations as possible.EMS consists of several components listed and ordered by dependency relationship:Exchange - Order destination, exchange, or broker.CoinAPI EMS Edge - Software that's responsible for communicating with the single specific order destination for which is deployed. This component exposes the EMS API for diagnostics purposes which functions visibility are limited to this single destination.CoinAPI EMS API - Software that's responsible for exposing fully functional the EMS API, maintaining the connection with all instances of CoinAPI EMS Edge.Customer Application - Customer software using the EMS API exposed by the CoinAPI EMS API component.Benefits and features​Low latency support​Specific projects usually involve High-Frequency Trading (HFT) or Market Making (MM) requiring low latency access to the order destination. EMS API was designed to have native support for this kind of activity.For every order destination in the cluster to which the submillisecond latency is required, these components should be deployed on a single server as close as possible to the order destination:CoinAPI EMS EdgeCoinAPI EMS APICustomer Application The closest proximity can be achieved using the:cloud region and/or availability zone the same as the destinationcollocation near the destinationcross-connect or direct-connect to the destination network infrastructureshortcutting the routers, SNAT/DNAT hosts, or proxies like CloudFlareThe cluster can naturally contain other order destinations at the same time in this setup, and this fact doesn't affect the latency to the locally provisioned destination(s).Normalized API abstraction​Our EMS API provides an abstraction layer that consolidates all supported third-party APIs into a single set of simple and robust data models and protocols. The Exchanges and the Assets are standardized using the Market Data REST API with which this product is compatible. More information about the exchanges and asset standardization can be found in the Documentation of the Market Data Product.Industry-standard protocols​Our API's can be accessed using multiple protocols widely adopted by the industry as a standard:RESTWebSocketFIX 4.4, 5.0FIXT 1.1Self-host or in Cloud​Deploy your property applications and trading algorithms in your company's collocated data centers or cloud providers if you need that, otherwise, let us manage the infrastructure and focus on using the API.Security & Privacy​Don't need to worry about the issues at the audit. Order flow, exchange API keys, or execution reports never leave your company infrastructure as the product is self-hosted.tipThe software complies with the ""SOC 2"" and ""ISO/IEC 27001 information security certifications.Multi-account support​Manage an unlimited number of exchange accounts in the cluster (for example, on behalf of your customers).SDK and samples for 40+ languages​We have the SDK libraries and code samples available for more than 40+ languages. The full list is available here: https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk/tree/masterComprehensive support​Leverage support for all market types and order types.High-quality integrations​Our integrations with third-party APIs are heavily tested and crafted with stability and latency in mind. For several third parties, we usually use multiple protocols simultaneously or tricks to acquire valuable pieces of information faster.Enterprise-grade support and maintenance​EMS product is fully supported and maintained to stay ahead of the curve. This approach offloads the often disliked responsibilities of the Software and DevOps Engineers in the organization and enables them to focus on the core business.High availability​The EMS software is designed to support high-availability deployments out of the box. For each order destination, we/you deploy multiple CoinAPI EMS Edge and CoinAPI EMS API components on different servers, availability zones, or cloud/infrastructure providers. Cluster using the service discovery backend, all components are automatically detected and interconnected.P&L and asset monitoring​Using the EMS, your organization can manage exposure and positions in real-time across all supported order destinations and build sophisticated risk management controls.Order lifecycle​This section will describe the lifecycle of the order in the EMS software.Order status description​This table describes how to interpret a specific order status.NameCan transit toStatus descriptionRECEIVEDREJECTEDROUTINGThe order is processed by the EMS.ROUTINGROUTEDThe order is (on the wire) between the EMS and the Exchange.ROUTEDREJECTEDNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order has been sent to the exchange and not yet active in the order book.NEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is active in the book in its original state.PENDING_CANCELNEWPARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDCANCELEDThe order cancelation message has been sent to the Order destination.PARTIALLY_FILLEDFILLEDPENDING_CANCELCANCELEDThe order is partially filled and active in the order book.FILLEDThe order is filled and removed from the order book.

Market orders don't have price protection, and because of that, they are not supported. As an alternative, you can use the Immediate or Cancel IOC order and provide the worst execution price to achieve the same result.Time in force​Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it expires.The table below describes how to interpret time in force parameter values.Time in forceShortcodeDescriptionGOOD_TILL_CANCELGTCA Good Till Cancel (GTC) is a default type of time-in-force. The order that lasts until is completed or canceled.GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGEGTTEThe Good Till Time Exchange (GTTE) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The exchange handles the execution of the cancel originated from parameter.GOOD_TILL_TIME_OEMLGTTOThe Good Till Time OEML (GTTO) time in force lets you set an expiration date and time up until which an order will be active in the book. The CoinAPI EMS Edge sending the cancel request originated from the parameter. Worth mentioning that: (a) The cancellation request will not be sent if the software will be not be running at the time of expiration. (b) This parameter does not depend on the exchange. (c) The clock of the server running CoinAPI EMS Edge is used to trigger the cancelation request at the expiration.FILL_OR_KILLFOKFill or kill (FOK) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed).IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCELIOCAn immediate or cancel order (IOC) is a type of time in force used to instruct an exchange to execute all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. This order will only remove liquidity from the order book. It will fill whatever part of the order it can immediately and cancel any remaining amount so that no part of the order is added to the order book.The table below displays a breakdown of the EMS support of specific time in force values by the Order destination.

This documentation provides a technical solution for simulating market orders using our limit order functionality with the Fill or Kill (FOK) option.Technical Solution​To mimic the behavior of a market order using our API, which inherently supports limit orders, clients can place a limit order with a Fill or Kill (FOK) condition. This approach effectively replicates the immediate execution characteristic of a market order while requiring the specification of a maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) price limit.Implementation Steps:Prepare the Order:Define the order as a limit order. Set the price limit to the maximum price the client is willing to pay for a buy order or the minimum price they are willing to accept for a sell order. Ensure that the order quantity meets the client's requirement for the transaction.Set the FOK Condition:Apply the Fill or Kill condition to the order. This condition mandates that the order must be executed immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It ensures that partial fills do not occur, closely aligning with the nature of a market order.Execution and Validation:Upon submission, the EMS will attempt to fill the order immediately based on the specified price limits and the FOK condition. If the order cannot be filled immediately and completely within the defined price range, it will be automatically cancelled, ensuring no partial fills.Advantages and Considerations​Immediate Execution: The FOK condition ensures that the order, if executed, is filled immediately, mirroring the behavior of a market order.Price Control: Clients maintain control over the maximum or minimum price limits, adding a layer of price protection that standard market orders do not provide.Simplicity: This method avoids the need for additional development or integration, utilizing the existing infrastructure of our API.Using a limit order API can be considered simpler and more straightforward for several reasons, especially when compared to other types of trading orders. Here are some factors that contribute to the perceived simplicity:Predictability and Control:Price Certainty: Limit orders allow users to specify the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. This provides certainty about the price, which is not the case with market orders, where the execution price can vary.Control over Execution: Users have better control over their trades. They can decide not to execute a trade if the market does not reach their specified price, avoiding unwanted entries or exits in volatile market conditions.Consistent behaviour: Not all the order destinations support market orders or when they support it, usually they are implmeneted in form of limit orders.Straightforward Implementation:Simplicity in API Design: Limit order APIs are generally straightforward to implement and integrate because the parameters are clear and well-defined (quantity, price, and sometimes duration).Fewer Real-time Considerations: Unlike market orders, where getting the best available price in real-time is crucial, limit orders are placed based on predefined criteria. This can reduce the complexity associated with rapid decision-making and real-time data processing.Reduced Need for Immediate Market Data:Less Dependency on Real-time Pricing: Since the execution of a limit order is based on the user's specified price, there's less need for immediate or real-time market data, unlike market orders where knowing the current market price is crucial for order execution.Cost Predictability:Avoidance of Slippage: With limit orders, the risk of slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed) is eliminated. Users can be more confident about the cost of their trades, making financial planning and risk management more straightforward.Ease of Monitoring and Management:Set and Forget: Users can place limit orders and not worry about monitoring the market constantly. The order will only execute if the market price meets the user's criteria, making it a more passive form of trading.Batch Processing Friendly: For applications or trading strategies that place numerous orders, limit orders can be more manageable as they don't require immediate processing or constant monitoring of market prices.Reduced Impact on Market Price:Minimized Market Disruption: Limit orders can be less disruptive to the market price, especially for large orders. They are executed only at the user's specified price, avoiding large, sudden impacts on the market price that can occur with large market orders.In summary, a limit order API can offer a simpler and more controlled trading experience, with price certainty, reduced need for real-time market data, straightforward implementation, and predictable costs. These factors contribute to its appeal, especially for users or systems focusing on strategic, planned trading activities rather than immediate, real-time market engagement.Time​For all input and output time values ISO 8601 standard is used.Format specifierDescriptionyyyyThe year as a four-digit number.MMThe month, from 01 through 12.ddThe day of the month, from 01 through 31.HHThe hour, using a 24-hour clock from 00 to 23.mmThe minute, from 00 through 59.ssThe second, from 00 through 59.fffThe milliseconds in a date and time value.fffffffThe ten millionths of a second in a date and time value.Input time values are parsed using the following formats as far as possible:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmyyyy-MM-ddTHHyyyy-MM-ddyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffffffyyyyMMddTHHmmssfffyyyyMMddTHHmmssyyyyMMddTHHmmyyyyMMddTHHyyyyMMddinfoWhen time zone information is not supplied, we will assume the UTC time zone.Output time values are formatted using the following patterns:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZyyyy-MM-ddinfoAll time values we provide are UTC time zone.

248,i.io api limits and billing metrics,"i.io api limits and billing metrics.   API limits and billing metrics | CoinAPI.io Documentation   Skip to main contentGitHubSearchGet a free API KeyWelcomeAuthenticationAPI limits and billingHow-to guidesMarket Data APIEMS APIFAQCustomer PortalChangelogAPI limits and billingOn this pageAPI limits and billing metricsAPI limits are a crucial aspect of any API product, and they exist for several important reasons. They are designed to ensure fair usage and maintain the quality of service for all users. By implementing these limits, we can prevent any single user from overloading the system, which could potentially degrade the performance for others. This is a standard practice across the industry and is essential for maintaining a high level of service.One of the key limits we have in place is the Concurrency limit. This limit is specifically designed to protect our infrastructure. It controls the number of simultaneous API calls/requests that can be executed at any given moment. Each API call/request increases the Concurrency limit against your quota, and it decreases when the call/request finishes. This ensures that our servers are not overwhelmed by too many simultaneous requests, thereby ensuring smooth and efficient operation.The specific limits that apply to you depend on several factors. These include the plan you have subscribed to, the product you are using, and the protocol you are utilizing. Different products and protocols may have different limits, reflecting their varying requirements and capabilities.We understand that different users may have different needs, and we try to accommodate these requests whenever possible. Therefore, some limits, such as the Concurrency limit, can be requested to be increased through our support team. We review these requests on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as your usage history and the capacity of our infrastructure.There are also limits that depend on your plan, such as the Request limit or the Node as a Service units limit. If you exceed these limits, you can continue to use our services by paying an overage fee. This allows us to maintain a high level of service for all users, even during periods of high demand.In conclusion, API limits are a necessary and important part of our service. They ensure that all users can enjoy a high-quality, reliable service, and they protect our infrastructure from being overwhelmed.Limits applied to our products​Product nameLimitsMarket Data REST APICredits LimitConcurrency LimitMarket Data WebSocket APIRequest Limit / IPHello Limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyMarket Data FIX APISession / APIKey Each API Key can have one session, and when next session is stablished then current is disconnectedMarket Data S3 APITODOEMS API Cloud MgmtConcurrency limit / APIKeyEMS API REST APINo limitsEMS API WebSokcet APINo limitsEMS FIX APISession / APIKeyEach API Key can have one session, and when next session is stablished then current is disconnectedNAAS REST APINAAS Credits LimitNAAS Concurrency LimitNAAS WebSocket APINAAS Credits Limit NAAS Concurrency LimitMultiple API keys for a subscription​At CoinAPI, we understand that our customers may have diverse needs and may require multiple API keys for a single subscription. We have designed our system to accommodate this requirement, allowing you to add additional API keys to your subscription. These keys operate within the confines of a single limit, ensuring that you have the flexibility you need without compromising on control.Each API key can be further customized with a more precise limit. This feature allows you to manage your usage effectively, ensuring that each key is used optimally and within its designated limit. This level of control can be particularly useful in managing resources and preventing overuse.In addition to these features, we also offer the ability for API calls using a specific API key to generate overage, i.e., exceed the quota. This can be particularly useful in situations where you anticipate a higher volume of calls. However, it's important to note that if the limit is exceeded, the API calls may be rejected to prevent overuse and maintain system integrity. All these settings, including the limits and the ability to set overage, can be managed from the Customer Portal. This ensures that you have complete control over your subscription and can make adjustments as and when needed.Customizing Limits for API Keys within a Subscription​If both API keys, each with a limit of 500, exhaust their allotted limits, reaching a combined total of 1000, further requests made using either key will be rejected until the limit resets. This ensures that the total usage across all keys within the subscription does not exceed the subscription limit.Exceeding Limits for API Keys within a Subscription​If one API key within the subscription exceeds its limit of 500, while the other key is still within its limit, requests made using the exceeded key will be rejected until the limit resets. However, requests made using the other key, which is still within its limit, will continue to be processed without interruption.infoIn summary, managing limits within a subscription involves ensuring that the usage across all API keys and services remains within the specified limits, with mechanisms in place to handle potential overages and maintain service availability and quality.X-CoinAPI-Limits Header​Overview​The X-CoinAPI-Limits header provides information about the usage limits and quota status for your API requests. By including the ForceInclude value in this header, you can ensure that you consistently receive information about the remaining and used limits in the response. While usage limit data is typically included in responses, it may be occasionally omitted for performance reasons. Using ForceInclude guarantees that the limit information is always included, ensuring up-to-date insights into your API usage.Usage​To receive real-time usage limit information in the response headers, include the X-CoinAPI-Limits header with the value set to ForceInclude in your API requests.Example:curl -X GET \ https://coinapi.io/v1/exchanges/ECB/apiKey-ED802AF4-E855-YOUR-API-KEY \ -H 'X-CoinAPI-Limits: ForceInclude' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json'Cache Duration​Please note that to optimize performance, the usage limit information is typically cached for 60 seconds. However, if the data is not available in the cache, the server may need to retrieve it from the backend system, potentially resulting in longer response times. Therefore, in scenarios where the data is not cached, response times may vary based on the current load on the system and backend processing times.Market Data / REST API​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively.

Each API Credit value is assigned based on the complexity and resource intensity of specific methods within the platform. The credit values range from 10 to 500, with each method having a distinct credit value.For instance, eth_call is assigned a value of 20 API Credits. These credit values take into account various intricate factors such as computational load, memory consumption, disk usage, and network resources associated with the execution of each method.This dynamic credit system ensures a fair and accurate representation of the resources utilized by different API methods, offering transparency and flexibility in aligning with CoinAPI.io's pricing plans.Request limit / APIKey​X-UnitsLimit-Quota-Overage: disabledX-UnitsLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000000X-UnitsLimit-Used: 0X-UnitsLimit-Quota-Remaining: 10000000HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-UnitsLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges.

These allow for more granular control over the data streams without the need to resend the entire subscription scope as previously required with the hello message.To subscribe to additional data types or filters without overriding existing subscriptions, send a subscribe message:Example subscribe message for book data related to ""BTC"" and ""ETH"":{ ""type"": ""subscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC"", ""ETH""]}This message adds subscriptions to the specified data types and filters, augmenting any existing subscriptions maintained in the session.Unsubscribe OUT​Similarly, to remove specific data types or filters from your current subscription, send an unsubscribe message:Example unsubscribe message to remove book data subscription for ""BTC"":{ ""type"": ""unsubscribe"", ""apikey"": ""a54fdcca-2d82-44c2-ae53-b95ab2363309"", ""heartbeat"": true, ""subscribe_data_type"": [""book""], ""subscribe_filter_asset_id"": [""BTC""]}The unsubscribe message removes the specified subscriptions without affecting other existing subscriptions.Subscribe vs Hello​In the realm of subscription management, three key actions allow you to fine-tune your information feed according to evolving requirements:Subscribe: This action expands your current subscription scope by adding new elements without discarding any existing ones. It's particularly useful for tailoring your feed as your interests or information needs grow.Unsubscribe: Through this option, you can selectively remove specific elements from your current subscription. It's an efficient way to declutter your feed by eliminating content that no longer serves your needs, without affecting the rest of your subscriptions.Hello: Use this command to initiate a fresh start. It clears your existing subscription slate and sets up a new scope from scratch. Opt for this when a complete overhaul of your subscriptions is needed, rather than just an adjustment.After your WebSocket connection is established, you must send us a hello or subscribe message which contains:Stream preferences (Heartbeat and subscription details)API key for authorizationIf your message will be incorrect, we will send you error message and disconnect connection afterwards.Hello message can be repeated, each one will cause subscription scope override without interruption of your WebSocket connection.Message parameters​ParameterTypeDescriptiontypestringMessage type, must be equal to one of the values: hello, subscribe or unsubscribeapikeystringYour API keyheartbeatbooltrue to receive Heartbeat message every second, otherwise falsesubscribe_data_typestring[]List of data types you want to receive (required, possible values listed in table below)subscribe_filter_symbol_idstring[]Filter data to symbols whose identifiers match at least one of the listed prefixes.

If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTSubscribe OUTUnsubscribe OUTSubscribe vs HelloMessage parametersData typesError handlingData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.

Today, crypto traders face challenges like limited liquidity causing slippage and difficulty in executing large orders without affecting market prices. Market volatility can also quickly erode profits and amplify losses, especially in less liquid markets. Additionally, using multiple trading platforms with different setups adds complexity to trading. The crypto market’s rapid changes and uncertain regulations further complicate trading and risk management. However, the CoinAPI Crypto Trading API tackles these challenges with efficient tools, quick data access, and simple multi-platform integration, enhancing the trading experience.    Core Functionalities of the CoinAPI EMS Crypto Trading API    The EMS Trading API is equipped with features designed to optimize trading strategies and enhance operational efficiency. Importantly, it enables traders to work more productively by targeting orders requiring high-touch interaction, managing trade risk, and demonstrating best execution. Additionally, full trade lifecycle support, integrated compliance, and workflow automation empower clients to manage the largest and most complex institutional portfolios on a single platform. Moreover, the EMS trading API eliminates the multiple interfaces, fragmented workflows, and order staging problems inherent in utilizing separate order and execution management platforms. Consequently, traders no longer have to switch between systems or re-key critical information, which helps save time and reduce errors. Furthermore, benefits beyond the trading desk include improved compliance and auditing, reduced operational risk, and simpler infrastructure, significantly enhancing overall trading operations. Advanced Order Types    Gone are the days of being limited to basic markets and limited orders. The EMS crypto trading API offers advanced order types like stop-loss, take-profit, iceberg, and more, enabling traders to execute complex strategies precisely, manage risks, and seize opportunities with less vigilance. Access To Market Data Real-time access to comprehensive market data is no longer a luxury but a necessity. The EMS crypto trading API bridges this gap by providing traders with immediate access to price feeds, order book data, historical trades, and market depth information from various exchanges and liquidity pools. This wealth of information is crucial for making informed decisions, analyzing market trends, and timing trades to perfection. Smart Order Routing In the quest for the best execution price, Smart Order Routing (SOR) emerges as a game-changer. It automatically identifies the most favorable path for trade execution across multiple markets and exchanges. Consequently, SOR ensures that traders not only secure the best prices but also minimize slippage and enhance profitability, marking a significant advancement in trading efficiency. Pre And Post-Trade Analysis The journey of a trade doesn’t end with execution; indeed, it extends into both pre and post-trade analysis. Initially, traders can evaluate the potential impact and cost of a trade beforehand, thereby gaining foresight into its implications. Subsequently, assessing its effectiveness afterward provides critical insight. This comprehensive view into market impact, execution quality, and cost analysis is invaluable, as it aids in refining strategies and significantly improving future performance. Trading Execution At the heart of the EMS crypto trading API lies its unparalleled trading execution capability, which is designed for speed, reliability, and efficiency. Firstly, it supports a wide array of trading strategies, including high-frequency and algorithmic trading, as well as manual execution. Consequently, this ensures rapid order fulfillment with minimal latency, facilitating a seamless trading experience. Order Management Comprehensive order management enables traders to thoroughly oversee all aspects of their orders, from initiation through to execution. This process includes, firstly, real-time order modifications and cancellations, followed by tracking. Additionally, it encompasses managing allocations and settlements, and, finally, ensuring optimal execution and compliance. One CoinAPI Crypto Trading API for the entire trade lifecycle    One API for the entire trade lifecycle ensures that traders can streamline strategies and workflows with one-click execution, manage programs as single orders, and monitor active orders and market data. Additionally, CoinAPI streamlines crypto trading by consolidating interfaces, workflows, and order management, effectively addressing fragmentation and staging issues. As a result, traders save time and reduce errors by not having to switch systems or re-enter information. Additionally, benefits like better compliance, lower risk, and simpler infrastructure improve the overall trading experience.    Real-World Use Cases The versatility of the EMS crypto trading API makes it an essential tool across various trading strategies and operations:    High-Frequency Trading (HFT): HFT traders benefit from the API’s quick execution on multiple exchanges, capturing fleeting arbitrage chances for precise, speedy returns. Algorithmic Trading: Traders with complex algorithms use the EMS crypto trading API for live market data and execution, ensuring swift strategy execution and market adaptability. Portfolio Management: Institutional investors and asset managers get powerful account management from the API, simplifying portfolio handling, risk assessment, and compliance. Market Making: The API supports market makers in placing orders efficiently, improving liquidity, narrowing spreads, and enhancing market stability. How does CoinAPI Crypto Trading API facilitate crypto trading?    The EMS Trading API by CoinAPI is more than just a tool; it’s a transformative force in cryptocurrency trading. As a top crypto trading API, it streamlines order execution, offers real-time market data access, and ensures secure account management.

Covering everything from real-time exchange rates to detailed historical data, we delve into the key offerings of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. This guide provides a comprehensive overview, equipping you with the insights to effectively navigate the crypto market using the diverse CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. Real-Time exchange rates At CoinAPI, our crypto exchange rates, a key aspect of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API, are calculated using the 24-hour Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP-24H). This calculation is derived from a variety of high-quality data sources, with a specific focus on “SPOT” data types. We meticulously exclude any data from sources that are not deemed legitimate. Our approach involves a combination of quotes, trades, and metadata datasets, applying strict criteria for spreads in quotes and placing a strong emphasis on midpoint data for accurate pricing. Trade volumes are integral to our VWAP24 algorithm, another component of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API. We give utmost priority to data freshness, updating the last 24-hour volume for each symbol every 4 hours and ensuring continuous updates every second. The algorithm is further enhanced with statistical filtering and a preference for high-ranking exchanges, ensuring the provision of the highest quality data. Lastly, we utilize a tree structure based on the VWAP24 data to determine the final exchange rates, guaranteeing that our users have access to the most current and accurate exchange rates as part of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API.  Historical analysis with CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API     CoinAPI offers a comprehensive solution for obtaining historical exchange rates between two assets, a crucial component of CoinAPI’s cryptocurrency data API, presented in an intuitive time series format.

Metrics CoinAPI offers a wide array of metrics to evaluate cryptocurrency exchanges, providing key insights into their performance and market dynamics. These metrics include: These metrics from CoinAPI are crucial for a thorough understanding of cryptocurrency exchanges, their operations, and market behavior. Order book data: Levels 1, 2, and 3 CoinAPI provides detailed order book data across three levels, each offering varying insights into market dynamics: Order Book Level 1 (L1): This basic level gives a snapshot of the market, ideal for a quick overview of current conditions and high-level market dynamics. Order Book Level 2 (L2): A more detailed level, L2 includes information on new and changing price levels, removed price levels, and individual trades, suitable for those needing deeper market insights. Order Book Level 3 (L3): The most detailed level, L3, offers comprehensive data including new, canceled, and matched orders, linking trades directly to order book orders. This is especially useful for high-frequency trading and detailed market analysis. CoinAPI’s REST API allows access to the current order book for specific symbols and their depth. Additionally, our WebSocket API provides real-time L2 order book data, ensuring the latest information is readily available for trading and analytical purposes. Order Book Snapshots CoinAPI offers a range of order book snapshots to suit various analytical needs, with intervals ranging from tick-by-tick to longer spans like 10ms, 100ms, 1s, and 10s. This variety allows users to choose the level of detail that best fits their trading and analysis strategies. The service includes: Order book snapshots feed (Level 2): Provides a complete snapshot of the order book with real-time updates, offering a thorough view of market dynamics. Book 5 – Order book snapshots feed (Level 2): Concentrates on the top 5 levels from each side of the book, giving a succinct yet detailed snapshot of market depth.

These diverse snapshot options from CoinAPI provide the tools necessary for close market monitoring and analysis, ensuring users have access to the detailed data needed for informed decision-making. Real-Time order book updates CoinAPI stands out for its ability to deliver real-time order book updates, a vital tool for market participants requiring the most current data. Each update from our platform includes comprehensive details such as the price level, the number of orders at that level, whether the orders are buy or sell, and the precise timestamp. These updates are transmitted within milliseconds, making them indispensable for trading strategies that depend on immediate market data. Additionally, CoinAPI offers a WebSocket endpoint for seamless real-time market data streaming. This feature ensures that users have continuous access to live market dynamics, enabling them to react swiftly to market changes and maintain a competitive edge in their trading and analysis. Quotes Quotes are crucial for traders and investors who depend on current information for making informed decisions. They typically include bid and ask prices, providing a snapshot of the current market demand and supply, and are a vital tool for assessing the market. In cryptocurrency, quotes are particularly important for algorithmic trading, where accuracy and speed are essential. They also form the basis for market analysis, aiding in identifying trends and gauging market sentiment. Additionally, quotes are used as reference points for executing trades, ensuring that transactions reflect the latest market conditions. Crypto OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) OHLCV data is a comprehensive summary of market activity within a specific timeframe, capturing crucial market movement aspects. This data is fundamental to technical analysis, helping traders identify market trends and patterns and providing insights into market psychology and potential future movements. It’s widely used in charting for visualizing market trends, creating trading indicators like moving averages and Bollinger Bands, and backtesting trading strategies. CoinAPI offers OHLCV updates for each symbol, with periods from 1SEC to 1MIN. Updates are sent when a period closes or every 5 seconds if the period has been updated but not closed, ensuring users have timely and accurate data for analysis and decision-making. Derivative Tick Info CoinAPI’s Derivative Tick Info provides essential data points for navigating the derivatives market, including: Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts, offering insights into the market depth and trader commitment. Funding Rate: The fee exchanged in perpetual contracts, reflecting the cost of maintaining positions and the degree of market leverage. Mark Price: The fair value of a derivative contract, used primarily in margin calculations to ensure fair trading. Index Price: The current price of the underlying asset in a derivatives contract, is crucial for contract valuation. This data is critical for participants in the derivatives market, aiding in understanding market dynamics, risk management, and assessing market health and sentiment. Traders use this information to gauge market sentiment, develop hedging strategies, and perform comprehensive risk assessments, making it an invaluable tool for informed decision-making in the dynamic world of derivatives trading. Liquidations Liquidations in trading occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s position due to their margin balance falling below the required maintenance margin, a measure to maintain the trading system’s integrity. These events are significant indicators of market volatility and the level of risk traders are taking on. High volumes of liquidations typically suggest extreme market conditions and can signal impending shifts in market dynamics.  This data is vital for thorough market analysis, aiding in evaluating market sentiment, identifying potential reversal points, and forming part of effective risk management strategies. Understanding trends in liquidations allows traders and analysts to gain valuable insights into current market conditions, enabling them to tailor their strategies more effectively. Trade volume data  Trade volume data measures the total cryptocurrency traded on an exchange within a specific period, acting as a key indicator of the exchange’s liquidity and the overall activity in the market. Its significance lies in its ability to reflect market dynamics; high trade volumes often correlate with heightened market activity and can signal the strength or importance of price movements. In market analysis, trade volume data is crucial for identifying trends, confirming chart patterns, and understanding supply and demand dynamics. Both analysts and traders depend on this data for informed decision-making, as it offers essential insights into market momentum and potential future trends. Latest Quotes Data CoinAPI provides the latest quote data for a broad range of cryptocurrencies, essential for high-frequency trading and strategies dependent on the most recent market data. This service is crucial for real-time trading systems where quick access to current market information is key to effective decision-making. It also plays a vital role in continuous market monitoring, helping traders and analysts keep pace with fast-changing market conditions. Quick traders, in particular, find this service invaluable for its ability to offer immediate updates, allowing them to respond rapidly to market shifts.  CoinAPI ensures users receive the latest updates for any chosen cryptocurrency symbol. New quote messages are triggered with each change in the order book’s top bid or ask level, providing an up-to-the-moment market snapshot.

CoinAPI’s blend of speed, precision, and thoroughness makes its latest quotes data a critical tool for traders and analysts in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Raw data CoinAPI distinguishes between aggregated and raw data types to cater to diverse data analysis needs. Aggregated data types, such as OHLCV and Exchange Rates, require a specific time period for aggregation, with our datasets starting from a minimum interval of 1 second. On the other hand, raw data types represent the pinnacle of real-time information, capturing every market nuance as it happens. This unaggregated, real-time data is disseminated continuously, ensuring that every update is promptly available. For those seeking the most granular level of market data, our historical API and flat files offer tick-by-tick data, accessible through our dedicated platform, Cryptotick.com. Providing the most detailed and granular data, raw data types are particularly valuable for custom analysis and the development of unique trading algorithms. Institutions and advanced traders leverage this data for conducting comprehensive market analysis, developing proprietary trading models, and for extensive research purposes. This level of detail and immediacy in data provision makes CoinAPI an essential resource for those requiring in-depth, real-time market insights. Flat Files CoinAPI’s Flat Files S3 API, a vital part of CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, is a RESTful interface designed for seamless access to data stored in flat file formats. This API is in line with Amazon S3 standards, offering the flexibility to integrate with existing Amazon S3-based infrastructure. While it shares similarities with Amazon S3, the Flat Files S3 API is specifically tailored for listing and downloading files, and does not cover the entire spectrum of Amazon S3 features. This specialized approach ensures that users can efficiently manage their data retrieval needs, a key aspect of utilizing CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, especially when accessing and downloading the extensive data archives provided by CoinAPI. Conclusion CoinAPI empowers users with the tools to make informed decisions, supported by detailed and real-time market insights. As a comprehensive cryptocurrency exchange API, we offer a wide array of data types, catering to various needs in real-time trading, historical analysis, and algorithm development.

Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer.

Our deep understanding of the true value of cryptocurrency APIs shapes our advanced platforms, ensuring seamless access to crypto data and operations.  The emergence of cryptocurrency APIs The landscape of digital finance has been dramatically reshaped by the appearance of the cryptocurrency API, a technological marvel that has transformed how we interact with the world of crypto trading. Cryptocurrency APIs offer a window into real-time market data, turning what was once a complex web of information into an accessible stream of opportunities.  Before the growth of cryptocurrency APIs, developers grappled with the challenge of accessing accurate market data, often entangled in outdated information and complex processes. The emergence of cryptocurrency APIs marked a significant turning point. These tools have not only simplified access to live data streams and automated trading strategies for developers but also opened new possibilities for financial institutions. Now, they can create more sophisticated and efficient trading ecosystems. At CoinAPI, we’re at the forefront of this technological revolution, empowering our clients to harness the full potential of digital finance and trading. In-depth benefits of cryptocurrency API The cryptocurrency API offers a range of critical features essential for navigating the crypto market. The foremost of these features is real-time data access. In a market known for its rapid price fluctuations, the ability to access immediate, up-to-date information through a cryptocurrency API is not just advantageous; it’s a must. These APIs empower traders to make quick, informed decisions by providing them with timely and accurate market insights. User-friendliness and reliability are also key attributes of a good cryptocurrency API. Designed with intuitiveness in mind, these APIs ensure that developers can easily integrate them into various applications, avoiding the complexities of complex data structures. This user-friendly design is matched by the reliability of the cryptocurrency API, which is crucial for delivering consistent, accurate, and current data.  Moreover, the efficiency in development offered by cryptocurrency APIs cannot be overstated. By simplifying and streamlining data collection and analysis, APIs significantly cut down the time and effort required for these processes. This allows developers to shift their focus toward innovation and the optimization of their applications. The cryptocurrency API, therefore, not only accelerates the development cycle but also cultivates a more creative and productive environment in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading. The critical role of data collection At the heart of cryptocurrency API effectiveness lies the pivotal process of data collection. APIs excel in aggregating, processing, and storing data from a multitude of sources, ensuring that the information is not only comprehensive but also highly relevant and tailored for diverse applications. This includes everything from real-time market monitoring to advanced predictive analytics. Key to this proficiency is efficient data collection methods, such as streamlined data importing and bulk data downloading, which guarantee that the datasets are both extensive and immediately usable. Our approach to data collection is what sets us apart. We gather each data source from at least three independent server sites across key global regions: APAC, NCSA, and EMEA. In each of these regions, we strategically position ourselves in multiple locations, ensuring proximity to the exchanges for optimal data retrieval. Daily, all collected data converges at a single point where we conduct a unique process. Here, we replay every market scenario from the perspective of all data streams, synthesizing them into a singular, most accurate market stream. This method effectively addresses and eliminates any occasional discrepancies that might not be simultaneously visible across all server sites. In terms of real-time data delivery, we prioritize proximity and efficiency. The data is always routed from the nearest edge server, ensuring it never leaves the continent, thus maintaining speed and reducing latency. Additionally, we employ advanced delivery methods to our clients, including cross-connects or VPC peering connections, utilizing robust platforms like Equinix, AWS, or GCP. This approach not only enhances the speed and reliability of data transfer but also aligns with our commitment to providing our clients with the most accurate and timely market data possible.

It brings a comprehensive suite of features tailored to the diverse and dynamic needs of this sector.

Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer.

Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer.

By monitoring transaction patterns, and exchange activity, and using analytics tools, Axyon AI can help identify potential anomalies and support decision-making. This can’t be possible without CoinAPI data allowing us to keep an eye on cryptocurrency exchanges for any unusual activity, such as large trades, price fluctuations, or sudden increases in trading volume."" explains Axyon AI Chief Technology Officer Jacopo CrediThe ChallengeAxyon AI faced the challenge of detecting anomalies in the volatile cryptocurrency market for accurate predictive analysis. Their goal was to find a reliable API providing precise cryptocurrency data that would enable them to pinpoint deviations in real-time in cryptocurrency assets. As a company deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence, Axyon AI has the capability to scrutinize massive amounts of data in real-time. This advanced analysis allows them to identify even the most subtle discrepancies, which can then be marked for further examination. Thus, their challenge was not just finding the right data, but also leveraging their sophisticated AI capabilities to turn that data into valuable insights.Here are the challenges Axyon AI facedLack of reliable, high-quality sources of historical and real-time cryptocurrency data to run crypto anomaly detection solutionAxyon AI encountered a challenge in finding trustworthy and high-quality streams of both historical and real-time cryptocurrency data. The obstacle they faced involved finding a comprehensive, single-source provider of all necessary cryptocurrency data. The alternative, integrating with various tools and manually sifting through each data source, was a cumbersome process that they aimed to avoid. Their goal was to find a streamlined solution that could seamlessly supply all the data they needed for their advanced analysis. Lack of aggregated dataAxyon AI faced a significant challenge due to the fragmented nature of information availability. The need to gather data from various sources presented an arduous and time-intensive task, necessitating individual research for each data segment. This lack of consolidated information was a major stumbling block in their quest for efficient and comprehensive data analysis.The manual process of getting data from multiple sourcesThe process of manually accumulating data from different sources is not only labor-intensive but also demands a certain level of expertise. The pursuit of market and cryptocurrency data involves sifting through a multitude of websites and vendors, which makes it exceptionally challenging to pinpoint a one-stop source for exhaustive data. Certain APIs may focus on specific cryptocurrencies or offer more extensive data on some than on others, further complicating the search for comprehensive and balanced information.The SolutionAxyon AI aimed to equip asset managers with advanced AI predictive solutions to ensure their success in the future. They were focused on providing their clients with an anomaly detection solution that could detect any irregularities in the cryptocurrency market. This enabled investors to make informed decisions and manage their investments with greater confidence.To achieve this, Axyon AI required reliable data on the crypto market. After thorough research, they decided to use CoinAPI as their data source due to its extensive and trustworthy coverage. With CoinAPI's dependable cryptocurrency information, Axyon AI created efficient machine-learning models to alert their clients of any potential disruptions or unusual behavior.“With CoinAPI, we have been able to develop effective machine-learning models which enabled us to warn our customers of potential market disruptions or unusual activity in a timely manner.

This top-tier market data has proven to be a time and resource saver for Axyon AI, allowing them to shift their focus towards devising solutions and developing AI models that propel business expansion.    Comprehensive coverage of cryptocurrencyCoinAPI, with its specialization in cryptocurrency data, offers broad coverage across a wide spectrum of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, among others. Their API delivers real-time pricing, historical data, trading volumes, order book data, and other pertinent metrics. By contrast, some other market data APIs might offer restricted coverage of cryptocurrencies, or possibly none at all. Hence, it's critical to select an API that caters to your specific demands in terms of the degree of coverage required.Save time and resources that would have otherwise been spent on data collection and processingEmploying a Market Data API can lead to significant savings in terms of time and resources that would have been expended on data gathering and processing. Rather than resorting to manual data collection from a variety of sources—a process that is both lengthy and susceptible to errors—a Market Data API supplies real-time data in a standardized format. This data can be seamlessly integrated into pre-existing systems and workflows, greatly enhancing efficiency and accuracy.Flexibility and ease of integration of the data APICoinAPI's Market Data API is engineered to provide adaptability and ease of integration with pre-existing systems, employing universally accepted formats and protocols.

Furthermore, Software Development Kits (SDKs) and libraries are readily available for these programming languages, simplifying the integration process. CoinAPI offers customization in data acquisition, catering to unique requirements with options like real-time streaming, batch downloads, and different data sets or subsets. It provides a combination of flexibility and convenience, operable across desktop applications, mobile apps, and web-based platforms. As such, CoinAPI serves as an invaluable asset for traders, investors, and developers, offering tailored access and analysis of market data.“Working with CoinAPI has been a game-changer for our Crypto Anomaly Detection solution.

As a result, they can now run their indexes in live time to track the dynamics of various cryptocurrencies. This covers a wide range of cryptocurrencies and allows for a more accurate analysis.“CoinAPI is a reliable real-time data feed provider for the indexes. The price/quality ratio is the best on the market. Being able to offer a real-time index gives us a great advantage, which is the primary benefit of partnering with CoinAPI” Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.Understanding the Power of Crypto Indices: Insights from Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30Cryptocurrency indices are crucial in monitoring the market dynamics of financial sectors in today's industry. Despite their vulnerability to significant cost unpredictability and administrative vulnerability, digital currencies have captivated the attention of a vast number of investors, making them impossible to ignore. In summary, digital currencies are here to stay, and indices allow products related to digital currencies to launch and enhance their presence within the conventional financial ecosystem.Crypto indices offer a simple way to get an overview of what is happening in the crypto markets. This saves time for crypto brokers and analysts who would otherwise need to search the entire market. For investors, crypto indices provide a way to diversify risk by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies at once. While mutual funds and ETFs are not yet prevalent in the crypto world, some people believe that investing in an index is a good alternative, allowing traders to diversify their portfolios with just one investment. Indices also make the cryptocurrency market more accessible and improve liquidity. The existence of indices can make non-crypto investors more inclined to take the crypto world seriously.CCi30, in order to be successful, needs access to reliable data, which is why they decided to use CoinAPI. To learn more about how the CCi30 crypto index tracks cryptocurrencies using real-time crypto data API, we spoke with Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.The ChallengeThe cryptocurrency market is unique and constantly changing, with new digital coins emerging and fading away on a daily basis. As cryptocurrencies have become a tradable asset class, there has been a growing need for an index product. CCi30 sought a reliable real-time data stream at a reasonable cost, and CoinAPI delivered just that - a high-quality data feed that is always accessible. In addition, CoinAPI offers customizable APIs that enable users to maximize their use of cryptocurrency data.“It was imperative to have access to dependable real-time data related to the index at a reasonable cost. This was essential for us because we wanted to provide our users with an accurate reflection of crypto market trends. Additionally, we were looking for a straightforward way to incorporate this information into our service without having to program it ourselves or hire someone else who would require a long period of instruction before being able to commence work.” Carlo said.Here are the challenges CCi30 facedLack of real-time crypto data APICCi30 faced a major challenge of procuring a market data API that could provide instantaneous access to both historical and real-time data on cryptocurrencies. They needed a streaming market data solution that could offer more than just minute or daily bar data.    Spending a lot of time collecting data from various resources CCi30 was struggling to gather necessary information from multiple sources, which was proving to be a time-consuming process. They were on the lookout for a partner who could join them quickly and provide all the required data. The task of combining data from different free sources, gathering it from various locations, and then making sense of it was challenging and frustrating. It would take a considerable amount of time to accomplish this task.Poor data qualityThe market data API's poor quality is a major issue for businesses that require trustworthy data to make informed decisions. These APIs are frequently unreliable, providing incorrect pricing information or outdated data. Furthermore, they may be slow or have other technical problems that make them difficult to work with. This all contributes to an unpleasant and unreliable market data API experience.The solutionCCi30 had to find a dependable real-time data feed to stay current in their ever-evolving industry. This was a crucial aspect of their index that was previously missing. With the help of CoinAPI’s real-time data feed, CCi30 can now provide their users with a precise index that is refreshed daily.“To be successful in the index industry nowadays, it is essential to have the capacity to analyze a huge amount of data from numerous sources and to calculate it accurately and quickly. Fortunately, there has been improvement in this area, and CCi30 is one of the major actors in the indices arena. Through CoinAPI, CCI30 can access thorough prices and market understanding of a wide selection of assets.” Carlo said.The CCi30 Cryptocurrency Indices were established to bring transparency to the constantly evolving market in a systematic manner. To create the indices, CCi30 Indices collected pricing information from CoinAPI, a dependable market data API provider known for its advanced services in the crypto asset industry.CCi30 opted to use CoinAPI's feed due to its reliability and affordability. CoinAPI provides price data for over 16,000 digital assets, including many cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Litecoin. The pricing data is sourced from more than 300 digital exchanges, which include the largest and most trusted ones, providing a significant portion of market liquidity.Results“CoinAPI's up-to-date data feed has helped us to make the cryptocurrency market more transparent by supplying accurate details about the behavior of individual digital currencies and the influence they have on other tokens in this ever-changing landscape.”CoinAPI provides real-time data to track the dynamics of various cryptocurrencies, making it easily accessible for software developers, analysts, and fintech-driven companies. They cover a wide range of cryptocurrencies and aim to create the most user-friendly APIs for their clients.CCi30 aggregates real-time price data from major exchanges on almost all distributed-ledger cryptocurrencies, making it the most comprehensive and accurate pricing benchmark in the industry. It tracks the 30 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins such as Monero, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic.Launched in 2017, CCi30 was created by a team of fund managers, mathematicians, and quantitative analysts. It is the most prominent index for cryptocurrencies and includes other tokens such as Litecoin, Ripple (CRP), and Monero in its index methodology.Here are the results CCi30 saw using CoinAPIReal-time stream of crypto data APIThe CCi30 team can now efficiently retrieve all financial reference, real-time pricing, historical pricing, and indices data related to trading currencies, currency derivative instruments, short-term money market instruments, and interest rate derivatives. This faster access to data enables the team to cover all aspects of trading comprehensively.     A reliable source of dataIt can be quite challenging to come across dependable data. Luckily, there is a trustworthy CoinAPI provider available. CoinAPI is a reputable source that offers both real-time and historical data to the financial markets.Have deep coverage of the cryptocurrency spaceThere are many indices available that measure the performance of the leading cryptocurrencies. However, these indices typically only cover a small number of coins and do not offer the same level of diversification as investing in a portfolio of stocks. This can make it difficult for investors to achieve meaningful diversification. Furthermore, these indices do not necessarily provide an accurate representation of the entire cryptocurrency market. Fortunately, the CCi30 index, powered by CoinAPI, is able to offer a broader range of assets for investors to consider.Reduce the volatility of trading prices and present a more stable price pointThe prices in the trading market can be highly unstable and uncertain. However, with CCi30 as your partner, the volatility is mitigated, and a more consistent price point is presented. This ensures that the risk of significant price swings is minimized, and the downside risk is reduced since the maximum price that a buyer or seller is willing to offer is already predetermined.“We are absolutely delighted to be partnered with CoinAPI. It is a firm that is driven by engineering and is highly focused on creating products. Their primary target is to offer the simplest and most convenient APIs to software developers and tech-savvy investors.
