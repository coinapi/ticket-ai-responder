What is a meme coin? Definition
A meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency that is inspired by internet memes, jokes, or pop culture references. These coins are typically created as a form of satire or humor, but they have gained significant attention and value in the crypto market due to their viral nature and community-driven promotion. Here are some key characteristics of meme coins:
Key characteristics of meme coins

Humorous or satirical origin
Meme coins often start as jokes or parodies of other cryptocurrencies. For example, Dogecoin was created as a parody of Bitcoin, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme​.
Community-driven 
The success of meme coins largely depends on the community that supports and promotes them. This can lead to high volatility as their value is often driven by social media trends and viral marketing rather than intrinsic utility​​.
High volatility
Meme coins are known for their dramatic price fluctuations. Their value can surge or plummet rapidly based on market sentiment and online hype​ – like when Elon Musk tweeted​ about Pepe Coin firing a coin value toward the moon.
Low or no fundamental utility
Many meme coins don’t have significant use cases or technological advancements. They primarily rely on their viral appeal and community engagement​. However, we’ll prove in this article that this doesn’t apply to all meme coins. Some promote environmental and charitable initiatives, others use the modern Play-to-Earn mechanism and some carry ground-breaking technology.
Speculative Nature
Investing in meme coins is highly speculative. While some investors have seen massive returns, the majority of meme coins can also lead to significant losses due to their volatile nature​.

Important! The meme coin prices listed below are for June 2024 and are approximate. Why so? First, because the prices of each cryptocurrency sometimes vary on different exchanges. Secondly, even if you are reading this article right after its publication, in the world of cryptocurrencies light years have passed and prices may have changed many times.
But don’t worry, because if you want, you can track live cryptocurrency prices, for example, thanks to the Market Data API, which we’ll tell you more about at the end of this article.
Ok, now let’s go on a journey through the crazy land of meme coins!
1. Dogecoin (DOGE)
Dogecoin (DOGE) was created in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Initially conceived as a joke or a “fun” cryptocurrency, it was inspired by the popular “Doge” meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. The creators aimed to create a more approachable and less serious alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin quickly developed a strong and active community. The coin gained mainstream attention, particularly due to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, who frequently tweeted about Dogecoin, significantly impacting its price and popularity (after the first tweet, it soared 20%).

One word: Doge
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2020

In addition, Elon’s Tesla introduced Dogecoin as one of the available means of payment. Over time, Dogecoin has been used for various charitable causes and crowdfunding efforts, further boosting its community engagement and visibility in the crypto market.

2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB) was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or group known as “Ryoshi.” The coin was designed as a direct competitor to Dogecoin, earning the nickname “Dogecoin killer.” The reason behind the creation of Shiba Inu was to capitalize on the popularity of dog-themed cryptocurrencies and the growing trend of meme coins. Upon its launch, Shiba Inu quickly gained traction, driven by its community and a series of strategic marketing campaigns. The coin’s popularity surged when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated a significant portion of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief fund in India, and burned the remaining tokens, effectively reducing the circulating supply. The market reacted positively to these moves, leading to massive price increases and widespread adoption within the crypto community. Shiba Inu also introduced its own decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, further enhancing its ecosystem and utility.

Polkadot aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain technology, including scalability, interoperability, and security. Launched in May 2020, Polkadot is designed to enable different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion; it allows for cross-chain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. This makes it a heterogeneous multi-chain framework. Polkadot’s core mission is to establish a web where our data is our own and isn’t stored on servers owned by internet companies.
The network employs a unique sharding technology called “parachains,” which are multiple parallel blockchains connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain. This design improves scalability and enables high transaction throughput. Polkadot’s governance model is also innovative, allowing token holders to have a say in the protocol’s direction, including updates and fixes without hard forks. Since its inception, Polkadot has gained significant market traction, becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization

How to create your meme coin?
Creating your meme coin is simpler than it sounds, and you don’t need to be a tech genius to do it. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
1. Conceptualize your meme coin
First, you need a fun and catchy concept. Think about a meme or a funny idea that resonates with people. Maybe it’s inspired by a popular meme, a quirky idea, or even a funny animal. Like a beaver.
2. Choose a blockchain platform
Decide where you want to launch your coin. Ethereum (ERC-20 tokens), Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20 tokens) are popular choices because they have a lot of support and tools to make the process easier. They also provide high-speed transactions and scalability.
3. Create the token
You can use online tools to create your token without any deep programming knowledge:

TokenMint or CoinTool: These websites let you create tokens with just a few clicks.
Ethereum and BSC: If you’re more tech-savvy, you can write a simple smart contract using Solidity for Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

4. Set up the token parameters
Decide on the name, symbol, total supply, and decimals (how divisible your token is). For example, “DogeDollars” (DOGE$) with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. Plan how the tokens will be distributed initially (e.g., presale, airdrop, team allocation).
5. Deploy the Smart Contract

Testnet deployment: Test your smart contract on a testnet like Ropsten (Ethereum) or BSC Testnet.
Mainnet deployment: Once you’re happy with the test, deploy your token on the mainnet. You’ll need some ETH or BNB for gas fees.

6. Spread the word
Create a website and social media profiles to promote your coin. Engage with communities on Reddit, Twitter, and Telegram. Memes thrive on community engagement. 
Start by listing your token on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap (for Ethereum) or PancakeSwap (for BSC).  As your coin gains traction, aim to list it on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.
7. Compliance and security
Last but not least, ensure your token complies with local regulations to avoid legal issues. You can ask a reputable firm to make security audit to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.
Meme coins market data – how to get it?
Mostly it’s simple. To get historical data, for example, for research purposes, you can use Cryptotick – market data in flat files. It’s an ideal choice for technical and non-technical users seeking comprehensive crypto historical data from all exchanges. It provides quotes, trades, OHLCV, and order book snapshots. Here are some of its key features:

Data format and storage

The data is stored in compressed (gzip highest available compression level) ASCII text files in CSV format. This ensures efficient storage and easy accessibility.

File split methodology

Data is organized efficiently, with each data type split into single files per symbol and trading day (UTC). This organization facilitates easy access and analysis.

Access and authorization

For Amazon S3 and Google GCP bucket upload options, CryptoTick requires specific authorization settings. For Amazon S3, disable the ACL in the object ownership section and attach the provided bucket policy. For Google GCP, add the service account [email protected] with storage admin access.

Sample data availability

CryptoTick provides sample data files for various data types, allowing users to evaluate the data quality and format. These samples cover a range of data types like quotes, trades, limit book snapshots, and OHLCV data.
For both, historical and real-time data on meme coins you can also use Market Data API which actively collects millions of data points, tick by tick, from over 350 cryptocurrency exchanges. This includes order books, executed transactions, quotes, and OHLCV data. The data is collected using REST, WebSocket, and FIX API protocols depending on what each exchange supports.
