Their goal was to find a reliable API providing precise cryptocurrency data that would enable them to pinpoint deviations in real-time in cryptocurrency assets. As a company deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence, Axyon AI has the capability to scrutinize massive amounts of data in real-time. This advanced analysis allows them to identify even the most subtle discrepancies, which can then be marked for further examination. Thus, their challenge was not just finding the right data, but also leveraging their sophisticated AI capabilities to turn that data into valuable insights.Here are the challenges Axyon AI facedLack of reliable, high-quality sources of historical and real-time cryptocurrency data to run crypto anomaly detection solutionAxyon AI encountered a challenge in finding trustworthy and high-quality streams of both historical and real-time cryptocurrency data. The obstacle they faced involved finding a comprehensive, single-source provider of all necessary cryptocurrency data. The alternative, integrating with various tools and manually sifting through each data source, was a cumbersome process that they aimed to avoid. Their goal was to find a streamlined solution that could seamlessly supply all the data they needed for their advanced analysis. Lack of aggregated dataAxyon AI faced a significant challenge due to the fragmented nature of information availability. The need to gather data from various sources presented an arduous and time-intensive task, necessitating individual research for each data segment. This lack of consolidated information was a major stumbling block in their quest for efficient and comprehensive data analysis.The manual process of getting data from multiple sourcesThe process of manually accumulating data from different sources is not only labor-intensive but also demands a certain level of expertise. The pursuit of market and cryptocurrency data involves sifting through a multitude of websites and vendors, which makes it exceptionally challenging to pinpoint a one-stop source for exhaustive data. Certain APIs may focus on specific cryptocurrencies or offer more extensive data on some than on others, further complicating the search for comprehensive and balanced information.The SolutionAxyon AI aimed to equip asset managers with advanced AI predictive solutions to ensure their success in the future. They were focused on providing their clients with an anomaly detection solution that could detect any irregularities in the cryptocurrency market. This enabled investors to make informed decisions and manage their investments with greater confidence.To achieve this, Axyon AI required reliable data on the crypto market. After thorough research, they decided to use CoinAPI as their data source due to its extensive and trustworthy coverage.
