The price/quality ratio is the best on the market. Being able to offer a real-time index gives us a great advantage, which is the primary benefit of partnering with CoinAPI” Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.Understanding the Power of Crypto Indices: Insights from Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30Cryptocurrency indices are crucial in monitoring the market dynamics of financial sectors in today's industry. Despite their vulnerability to significant cost unpredictability and administrative vulnerability, digital currencies have captivated the attention of a vast number of investors, making them impossible to ignore. In summary, digital currencies are here to stay, and indices allow products related to digital currencies to launch and enhance their presence within the conventional financial ecosystem.Crypto indices offer a simple way to get an overview of what is happening in the crypto markets. This saves time for crypto brokers and analysts who would otherwise need to search the entire market. For investors, crypto indices provide a way to diversify risk by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies at once. While mutual funds and ETFs are not yet prevalent in the crypto world, some people believe that investing in an index is a good alternative, allowing traders to diversify their portfolios with just one investment. Indices also make the cryptocurrency market more accessible and improve liquidity. The existence of indices can make non-crypto investors more inclined to take the crypto world seriously.CCi30, in order to be successful, needs access to reliable data, which is why they decided to use CoinAPI. To learn more about how the CCi30 crypto index tracks cryptocurrencies using real-time crypto data API, we spoke with Carlo Scevola, CEO of CCi30.The ChallengeThe cryptocurrency market is unique and constantly changing, with new digital coins emerging and fading away on a daily basis. As cryptocurrencies have become a tradable asset class, there has been a growing need for an index product. CCi30 sought a reliable real-time data stream at a reasonable cost, and CoinAPI delivered just that - a high-quality data feed that is always accessible. In addition, CoinAPI offers customizable APIs that enable users to maximize their use of cryptocurrency data.“It was imperative to have access to dependable real-time data related to the index at a reasonable cost. This was essential for us because we wanted to provide our users with an accurate reflection of crypto market trends. Additionally, we were looking for a straightforward way to incorporate this information into our service without having to program it ourselves or hire someone else who would require a long period of instruction before being able to commence work.” Carlo said.Here are the challenges CCi30 facedLack of real-time crypto data APICCi30 faced a major challenge of procuring a market data API that could provide instantaneous access to both historical and real-time data on cryptocurrencies. They needed a streaming market data solution that could offer more than just minute or daily bar data.             Spending a lot of time collecting data from various resources CCi30 was struggling to gather necessary information from multiple sources, which was proving to be a time-consuming process. They were on the lookout for a partner who could join them quickly and provide all the required data. The task of combining data from different free sources, gathering it from various locations, and then making sense of it was challenging and frustrating. It would take a considerable amount of time to accomplish this task.Poor data qualityThe market data API's poor quality is a major issue for businesses that require trustworthy data to make informed decisions. These APIs are frequently unreliable, providing incorrect pricing information or outdated data. Furthermore, they may be slow or have other technical problems that make them difficult to work with. This all contributes to an unpleasant and unreliable market data API experience.The solutionCCi30 had to find a dependable real-time data feed to stay current in their ever-evolving industry. This was a crucial aspect of their index that was previously missing. With the help of CoinAPI’s real-time data feed, CCi30 can now provide their users with a precise index that is refreshed daily.“To be successful in the index industry nowadays, it is essential to have the capacity to analyze a huge amount of data from numerous sources and to calculate it accurately and quickly.

However, these indices typically only cover a small number of coins and do not offer the same level of diversification as investing in a portfolio of stocks. This can make it difficult for investors to achieve meaningful diversification. Furthermore, these indices do not necessarily provide an accurate representation of the entire cryptocurrency market. Fortunately, the CCi30 index, powered by CoinAPI, is able to offer a broader range of assets for investors to consider.Reduce the volatility of trading prices and present a more stable price pointThe prices in the trading market can be highly unstable and uncertain.
