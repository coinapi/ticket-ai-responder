                    key features of our data
                





                        Backtesting
                        ready
                    
We are additionally timestamping data using the same synchronized clock for all exchanges when we first receive it, which gives the possibility of significantly more accurate backtesting of algorithmic trading strategies.





Redundancy
Our geographically dispersed infrastructure eliminates data errors and increasing amount of the updates we archive. Data collected from multiple locations is consolidated into the single stream available to download on our site.






                        Survivorship
                        bias-free
                    
In early developing markets, avoiding survivorship bias is essential. To prevent the issue, you can download data from closed exchanges or delisted symbols in our platform.






                        Processed
                        data
                    
In addition to the raw exchange data, we are providing various types of processed data like OHLCV time series created from active market data (transactions).
