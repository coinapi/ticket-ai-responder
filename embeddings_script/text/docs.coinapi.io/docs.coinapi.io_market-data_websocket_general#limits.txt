all errors are permanent and you should expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed by us after sending an error message.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere for further manual review.Limits​API access is subject to limits and n this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / IP​X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-Limit: 10X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMs: 10000X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-Remaining: 0X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMs: 564We define WebSocket request as the event when the WebSocket upgrade on the HTTP is happening. The request limit restricts the number of maximum allowed newly initiated WebSocket connections per IP address in a time interval (sliding/rolling window ending at a specific moment) for your subscription. Limit prevents your client application from abusing the API by reconnecting in the loop without exponential backoff.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-LimitintValue of the limit quota allocated.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-RemainingintValue of the limit quota left at the moment, counted from last WindowSizeMs milliseconds.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMsintWindow size on which the remaining value was calculated in milliseconds.X-WsRequestsPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMsintThe number of milliseconds after which Remaining > 0. (exist only in case of the error)Hello limit / IP​X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-Limit: 10X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMs: 10000X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-Remaining: 0X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMs: 564The hello limit restricts the number of maximum allowed hello messages per IP address in the time interval (sliding/rolling window ending at a specific moment) for your subscription. Limit prevents your client application from abusing the API by changing the scope of the subscription.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-WsHelloPerIpLimit-LimitintValue of the limit quota allocated.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-RemainingintValue of the limit quota left at the moment, counted from last WindowSizeMs milliseconds.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-WindowSizeMsintWindow size on which the remaining value was calculated in milliseconds.X-WsHelloPerIpLimit-RetryAfterMsintThe number of milliseconds after which Remaining > 0. (exist only in case of the error)Concurrency limit / APIKey​X-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum allowed concurrent websocket connections per APIKey at the current moment. Every new WebSocket connection increases the Concurrency limit against quota, and when it's closed, decreases it.HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-ConcurrencyLimit-LimitintConcurrency limit allocated for your API key.X-ConcurrencyLimit-RemainingintThe number of concurrent WebSocket connections available to be established in this moment for your API key.Data buffering​Data buffering JSON error message is structured like this:{  "type": "error",  "message": "Reached maximum allowed buffered messages for this connection."}The stream will send the data to the client as fast as possible; this can result in a high volume of data in cases where the subscription scope is broad. If our server cannot write data to the stream because of the TCP backpressure most likely caused by your client is not reading the data fast enough, or there is not enough network bandwidth available, we will buffer the messages to allow your client to catch up. However, when the buffer is full, a disconnect will be initiated from the server-side, and the buffered messages are dropped, and they will not be resent to the client.One way to identify when your client is falling behind is to compare the CoinAPI time of the messages being received with your current time on the client and track this metric over time. Make sure your clock is synchronized correctly and do not have a drift.The possible causes of the buffering are limited and are related to:Bandwidth bottleneck, eg.Internet connection instabilityNot enough bandwidth to receive a full stream.Network card or link saturation.I am not receiving messages fast enough, eg.Lack of the thread separation between the (a) receiving thread or (b) parsing or (c) processing operations.No CPU affinity on the receiving thread.CPU bottleneck on the receiving thread.Infrequent collection of the data from the TCP stack.Heap allocation per message and Garbage Collector pressure.If your client is unable to receive messages fast enough because of the issues listed above, then these things will happen:Your client TCP stack will be full, and TCP window will be closed to inform us that you can't receive more data and we should not send to youOur TCP stack queue will be full because we couldn't send you more dataWe will internally create a limited queue of the messages to deliver when the channel is available again (this could cause the delay on the real-time data before the gaps will appear)If the queue is full, then we will disconnect you.To minimize the occurrence of disconnects:Make sure that your client is reading the stream fast enough. Typically you should not do any real processing work as you read the stream. Read the stream and hand the activity to another thread/process/data store to do your processing asynchronously.Make sure that your data center has inbound bandwidth sufficient to accomodate large sustained data volumes as well as significantly larger spikes (e.g. 10x normal volume). The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages.For more information please google: TCP Flow Control.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousEndpointsNextMessagesHello OUTHello message parametersData typesError handlingLimitsRequest limit / IPHello limit / IPConcurrency limit / APIKeyData bufferingCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
