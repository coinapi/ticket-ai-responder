For example, to calculate the exchange rates of BTC/USD, we also incorporate BTC/CNY, BTC/JPY, BTC/GBP, BTC/EUR.Exchanges are representing a different level of market data quality. To account for that factor our algorithm uses trustworthy exchanges first and if the data could not be produced using this set of exchanges, for example, a specific asset requested is not available on any of the trustworthy exchanges, then we are using all other exchanges to produce requested data. This approach of combining credible and less trusted data sources, giving our customers an overview of the whole market without compromising the data quality.Reference:[1] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/exchange-ratesWas this section helpful?12345PreviousGeographic locations and the LatencyNextHow can I get OHLCV data by asset pair?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
