Endpoints are crucial in the interaction between different software systems, providing precise locations where services can be requested and data can be exchanged.Key Characteristics​URL Structure: Each endpoint is identified by a unique URL, which specifies the path to a particular resource or service within the API.Methods: Endpoints support various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, which define the type of operation to be performed.Parameters: Endpoints often accept parameters, either as part of the URL or in the request body, to filter, sort, or specify the data to be manipulated.Importance​Access Control: Endpoints help in defining the scope of access, ensuring that only authorized requests can retrieve or modify the data.Modularity: By structuring APIs into distinct endpoints, developers can create modular and maintainable code.Interoperability: Endpoints enable different systems to communicate and share data seamlessly, fostering integration and interoperability.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousChain (Blockchain)NextJSONEndpointCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
