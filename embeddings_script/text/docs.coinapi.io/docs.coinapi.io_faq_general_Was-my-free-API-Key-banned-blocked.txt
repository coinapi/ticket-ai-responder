So it is possible to have multiple API keys under a single account.You can have only a single free API key and an unlimited number of paid subscriptions; paid subscriptions and single free API key usage are allowed at the same time.
To continue using the free plan after the ban, another free API key needs to be provisioned on a different email address, but this can happen again if the rules will not be satisfied.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousSome symbols have extra identifiersNextWe need a OneZero FIX API session, is this possible?Copyright Â© 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
