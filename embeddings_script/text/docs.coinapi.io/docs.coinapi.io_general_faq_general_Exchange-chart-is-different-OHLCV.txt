Internally we do not try to match the data source chart. A quick summary to give light as to why our data is different: Every exchange can aggregate differentlyWe aggregate from real-time streamWe aggregate sometimes on time of reception Because of that, the data could be different. We do not try to match that. We are performing the same aggregation across all data sources to have unification across them.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousDoes CoinAPI provide asset icons/images of the cryptocurrencies?NextHow can I set custom timezone in the data?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
