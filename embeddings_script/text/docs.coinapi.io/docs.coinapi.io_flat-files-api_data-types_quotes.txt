This data is crucial for understanding the current state of the market and the spread between buy and sell orders.File Organization​Quote data is organized in the S3 bucket as follows:quotes/└── YYYYMMDD/    └── [EXCHANGE_ID]-[SYMBOL_ID].csv.gzExample: quotes/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT.csv.gzFile Format​Files are in CSV format, compressed with gzip. Each row represents a single quote update.Data Fields​Column NameTypeDescriptionid_site_coinapistringUUID of the site which received the quote.

These are typically valid market conditions rather than errors.time_exchange vs time_coinapi: If these times are equal, it means the exchange did not provide a timestamp, and we're using our receipt time for both fields.File Splitting​For exchanges or trading pairs with high update frequencies, a single day's data may be split across multiple files to manage file sizes. In such cases, the files will be named with an additional sequence number:quotes/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT_001.csv.gzquotes/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT_002.csv.gzUsage Tips​When analyzing spread, calculate it as ask_px - bid_px.The ask_sx and bid_sx fields can be used to gauge market depth at the best prices.Comparing time_exchange and time_coinapi can provide insights into latency between the exchange and our data collection points.For any questions or issues with the Quotes data, please contact our support team.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousData & StructureNextTradesOverviewFile OrganizationFile FormatData FieldsExample DataData Collection ProcessCorner Cases and Special ConsiderationsFile SplittingUsage TipsCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
