If you receive a snapshot in the middle of the connection, then you must invalidate the previous order book state and apply the snapshot as the current state of the book.You could process updates to the book only if you received a snapshot for that book.Snapshot will be delivered instead of the first order book change after establishing a WebSocket API subscription. More information: https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/websocket/messages#orderbook-l2-full--inWas this section helpful?12345PreviousHow do I enable overage?NextHow granular is your data?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
