document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.Variables naming​All variables are named using the Snake case (or snake_case) naming convention.
This means that words are separated by a single underscore _ character, no spaces are used, and letters are lowercase.Asset codes​ISO 4217 currency code standard is used for fiat money identifications.
Cryptocurrency assets are identified using codes used by the general public or adopted by the majority of exchanges.Exchange codes​Exchange on our platform is identified by the specific exchange API and the matching engine behind it. When the example exchange has multiple separate APIs, e.g., for different products SPOT, OPTIONS, or to cover other regions, we will expose these symbols from these respective APIs on different exchange identifiers.  Below are examples of BINANCE (multiple APIs, multiple regions) and DERIBIT (single API, single region).
