Our sophisticated authorization process ensures secure and fair access across all CoinAPI products, including but not limited to market data, trading APIs, and analytics tools. This document outlines the key aspects of our authorization flow, focusing on quota management, pay-as-you-go functionality, and advanced authentication methods that apply uniformly across our product suite.Authorization Flow​API Key ValidationOrganization ValidationJWT Token Processing (if applicable)Quota Checks and Pay-As-You-Go Handling1. API Key Validation​We verify the API key's validity and its association with the requested CoinAPI product (if specified).2. Organization Validation​We ensure the API key is linked to an active organization.3. JWT Token Processing​For API keys with JWT authentication enabled:a. Token Extraction and ValidationWe extract and decode the JWT from the Authorization header.We verify the token's signature and expiration.b. CachingValid tokens are cached to optimize performance on subsequent requests.4. Quota Checks and Pay-As-You-Go Handling​Our quota system is designed to provide flexible usage control at both the API key and organization levels, with special considerations for pay-as-you-go accounts.a. API Key-Specific QuotasThese quotas are set by the customer through our Customer Portal for each API key.Examples include:Maximum number of requests per dayRate limits (e.g., requests per minute)Access restrictions to specific endpoints or data typesThese quotas are always checked, regardless of the organization's pay-as-you-go status.b. Organization-Wide QuotasThese quotas apply across all API keys associated with an organization and are determined by the organization's subscriptions and committed-use plans.They are independent of individual API keys and reflect the overall service level acquired by the organization.Typical quota types include:Total data volume limitsAggregate request limits across all keysAccess to premium features or data setsc. Pay-As-You-Go and Quota EnforcementWhen pay-as-you-go is enabled for an organization:Only API Key-specific quotas are strictly enforced.Organization-wide quotas are monitored but not strictly enforced.Requests are allowed to exceed organization quotas if the account is in good standing.Account standing is determined by:Current account balanceAvailable post-paid credit limitThis allows organizations to continue using CoinAPI services beyond their base subscription limits, providing flexibility for unexpected spikes in usage or growing needs.d. Billing and Credit ChecksFor organizations with pay-as-you-go enabled:We check the organization's current account balance and available credit.Usage is allowed to continue as long as the account remains in good standing.If the account reaches its credit limit or has outstanding unpaid balances:Further requests may be restricted until the account is brought back into good standing.e. Autocharge FeaturePay-as-you-go customers can enable the autocharge feature to maintain continuous good standing.When enabled, this feature automatically charges the customer's payment method when their balance falls below a specified threshold.Benefits of autocharge:Ensures uninterrupted access to CoinAPI servicesPrevents sudden service interruptions due to exceeding credit limitsSimplifies account management for high-volume usersCustomers can set and adjust autocharge thresholds and limits through the Customer Portal.Special Cases​Email + Token Authentication​We support email-based authentication using a Bearer token:If API key validation fails, we attempt to authenticate using the email extracted from the Bearer token.We verify the email's association with the organization linked to the provided identifier.This method enables organization-level authentication without requiring a specific API key, useful for certain administrative or bulk operations across CoinAPI products.Dynamic Quota Adjustment​Our system supports real-time quota adjustments:Customers can modify API key quotas through the Customer Portal, with changes reflected immediately across all CoinAPI products.Organization quotas are automatically adjusted when subscription changes or committed-use plan modifications are processed.Pay-as-you-go status can be enabled or disabled, affecting how organization quotas are enforced across all services.Quota Overage Handling​Quota overage handling depends on the pay-as-you-go status:For API key quotas:Requests are typically rejected with a specific error code when exceeded, regardless of pay-as-you-go status.For organization quotas:With pay-as-you-go enabled:Usage can continue beyond organization quotas as long as the account is in good standing.Usage is monitored and billed according to the organization's plan rates.If autocharge is enabled, the account is automatically topped up to maintain good standing.Without pay-as-you-go:All API keys for the organization will be restricted when quotas are exceeded.Service resumes when the quota resets (e.g., start of a new billing cycle) or the subscription is upgraded.Monitoring and Notifications​We maintain comprehensive monitoring of our authorization layer to ensure system health and optimal performance across all CoinAPI products. This includes tracking various aspects of the authorization process, quota utilization, and account status. Our monitoring system generates notifications for both internal teams and customers when certain thresholds are reached or unusual patterns are detected. This proactive approach allows us to address potential issues quickly and helps customers stay informed about their API usage and account status across all CoinAPI services.Conclusion​Our authorization process is designed to provide secure, flexible, and scalable access to all CoinAPI products. By implementing multi-layered validation, sophisticated quota management based on subscriptions and committed-use plans, and flexible pay-as-you-go options with autocharge capabilities, we ensure that our services remain protected while offering customers the ability to scale their usage according to their needs. The combination of API key-specific controls, organization-wide quotas, and pay-as-you-go flexibility provides a powerful toolset for managing API access and usage across diverse use cases and organizational structures, ensuring uninterrupted service for accounts in good standing across the entire CoinAPI product suite.Was this section helpful?12345NextCustomer PortalOverviewAuthorization Flow1.
