To ensure that we promptly respond to your API calls and avoid unnecessary delays, we choose to provide a response without including the response headers. This decision is made with the intention of optimizing the operation of our API. By selectively excluding the inclusion of response headers in every request, we can enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the API.It takes a while to verify the current usage as for the very first call for a given client we do not have a rate limit then yet.
Once the request is made, we start the rate limit verification process In the background. We may then in the meantime process many requests for this client and at some point we append the result of current usage to the header.
All requests that were made during that process are also included in the limit after some time.For example (each bullet point representing a request made):Request (no info about clients usage)What's the usage? Starting the verificationRequestRequest5 requests used today (those 3 above are not counted yet), appended to the headerRequest (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (5 used)Request (10 requests used today)To provide clarity and transparency regarding the absence of response headers, we have documented this behavior on our official documentation page, which can be found at https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api#request-limit--apikeyWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhere can I find examples and SDK source codes for API?NextWhy are there no Exchange Rates data for some assets for a given period?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
