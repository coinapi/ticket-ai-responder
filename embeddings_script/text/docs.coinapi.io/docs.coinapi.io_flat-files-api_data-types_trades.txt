This data is crucial for understanding market activity, price movements, and trading volumes.File Organization​Trade data is organized in the S3 bucket as follows:trades/└── YYYYMMDD/    └── [EXCHANGE_ID]-[SYMBOL_ID].csv.gzExample: trades/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT.csv.gzFile Format​Files are in CSV format, compressed with gzip. Each row represents a single trade.Data Fields​Column NameTypeDescriptiontime_exchangedatetimeUTC timestamp of the trade provided by the exchange or estimated using the exchange API delay.time_coinapidatetimeUTC timestamp when CoinAPI first received the trade information.guidstringUnique identifier of the trade provided by CoinAPI.pricedecimalPrice at which the trade occurred.base_amountdecimalAmount of base asset traded in the transaction.taker_sidestringAggressor side of the transaction.

These estimations are based on order book data and may not always be 100% accurate.Trade Reversals: In rare cases, exchanges might reverse or cancel trades. These are typically not reflected in our data, so be aware that very recent trade data might be subject to change on the exchange itself.File Splitting​For highly active trading pairs, a single day's data may be split across multiple files:trades/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT_001.csv.gztrades/20230701/BINANCE-BTCUSDT_002.csv.gzUsage Tips​Use the guid field to uniquely identify trades and avoid double-counting when processing multiple files.The base_amount field represents the amount in the base currency of the trading pair (e.g., BTC in BTC/USDT).To calculate the total value of a trade in the quote currency, multiply price by base_amount.When analyzing trade direction, consider using only BUY and SELL categories for the most accurate data, or include estimated values if you need more comprehensive data.For any questions or issues with the Trades data, please contact our support team.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousQuotesNextFull Limit Order BookOverviewFile OrganizationFile FormatData FieldsExample DataData Collection ProcessTaker Side ExplanationCorner Cases and Special ConsiderationsFile SplittingUsage TipsCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
