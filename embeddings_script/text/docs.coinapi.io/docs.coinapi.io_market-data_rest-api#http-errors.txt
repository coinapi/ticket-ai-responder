REST API only supports pooling, meaning you can periodically request the current market data state. In streaming, you subscribe and data or updates are delivered to you continuously.General​If you want to learn how to authenticate to this API, you can find detailed instructions and guidance in
authentication section of this documentation.HTTP Requests​Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json as all our responses are in JSON format.We encourage you to use the HTTP request header Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip for all requests.
This will indicate to us that we can deliver compressed data to you which on your side should be decompressed transparently.tipBy allowing data compression you are lowering bandwidth requirements by approximately 80%.
This is important for requesting large amounts of data or using WebSocket Streaming API,
as we can deliver data to you faster and more effectively.HTTP Success​Successful HTTP responses have the status code 200 and the body in a format according to documentation of the requested resource.infoYou should always check that your HTTP response status code is equal to 200, otherwise the requested was not successful.HTTP Errors​Error message is returned in JSON structured like this:{    "error": "Invalid API key"}All HTTP requests with response status codes different to 200 must be considered as failed
and you should expect additional JSON inside the body of the response with the error message encapsulated inside it as shown in the example.
We use the following error codes:Error CodeMeaning400Bad Request -- There is something wrong with your request401Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong403Forbidden -- Your API key doesnt't have enough privileges to access this resource429Too many requests -- You have exceeded your API key rate limits550No data -- You requested specific single item that we don't have at this moment.infoGood practice is to store all error messages somewhere along with request data for further manual review.Limits​Any authenticated endpoint is providing (in HTTP response headers) information about the current state of the limits associated with API Key. In this section we will describe each limit.Request limit / APIKey​X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999989X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2018-01-22T15:25:15.1234567ZThe request limit define number of maximum requests that could be executed in the 24 hours period (sliding/rollowing window - always last 24 hours from specific moment) for your subscription.We define request as data request credits and this is not always equal to the number of API calls executed against the API. A request is deemed to be a single one if the limit query parameter on the endpoint isn’t available, isn’t used or it's stated otherwise in the API documentation. Otherwise — if the limit query parameter is available and is used — then each of the 100 data points returned in the response is counted as one request.For example at the 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC value of the requests remaining (X-RateLimit-Remaining) will be equal to the allocated quota (X-RateLimit-Limit) decreased by the sum of the request costs (SUM(X-RateLimit-Request-Cost)) executed in the period 2019-08-21 13:00 UTC - 2019-08-22 13:00 UTC (last 24 hours).HTTP HeaderTypeDescriptionX-RateLimit-UsedintProvides information about the request limit that has been used within the last 24-hour period. This header indicates the amount of request capacity consumed based on the usage history. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-LimitintIs an optional feature that can be enabled via the customer portal to impose a limit on the capabilities of a specific API key. It allows you to define a threshold for the number of requests that can be made using a single API key within a 24-hour time frame.X-RateLimit-RemainingintProvides information about the number of requests that can still be made within the last 24-hour period based on the usage history. This header serves as a helpful indicator of the remaining request capacity, allowing API consumers to manage their usage effectively. It is important to note that the header is not always appended to every request to optimize the operation of the API.X-RateLimit-Request-CostintThe number of requests used to generate current HTTP response.X-RateLimit-ResettimestringThe time when all provisioned requests are available to execute again if no more requests will be executed.X-RateLimit-Quota-OveragestringProvides information about whether a given API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame, which could result in additional charges. This header is fully defined and configured in the customer portal.X-RateLimit-Quota-AllocatedstringTotal number of requests that can be made within a specific subscription during a 24-hour time frame. This quota allocation is determined based on the user's subscription purchase.X-RateLimit-Quota-RemainingstringProvides valuable information about the remaining quota within the subscription for making requests within a 24-hour time frame. This header indicates the number of requests that can still be made within the allocated quota for the current 24-hour period.GET v1/exchanges/ECB/apiKey-ED802AF4-E855-YOUR-API-KEYHost: coinapi.ioX-RateLimit-Used: 1000X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001ZX-RateLimit-Quota-Overage: ENABLEDX-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000Explanation:X-RateLimit-Used: 1000 (requests used in the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000 (total request limit within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4000 (requests remaining within the last 24 hours)X-RateLimit-Request-Cost: 1 (cost or "weight" of each individual request)X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-05-05T12:00:00.0000001Z (when the rate limit will reset within a 24-hour period)X-RateLimit-Overage: ENABLED (API key may exceed the plan quota within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Allocated: 10000 (total number of requests allowed for all API keys within the subscription within a 24-hour time frame)X-RateLimit-Quota-Remaining: 5000 (requests remaining within the subscription's allocated quota within the last 24 hours)Concurrency limit / APIKey​X-ConcurrencyLimit-Limit: 10X-ConcurrencyLimit-Remaining: 5The concurrency limit defines the number of maximum concurrent API calls/requests that the API could process for your subscription at the current moment.

This section will do as best as possible to keep all information up to date on how you could load the data into these applications. Feel free to contact support if we are missing an option.CSV download, import:​Open the data in the CSV format from the browser eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvSave the data to the file with the .csv extension.Use the file saved and import it into the software.When configuring import, refer to the parameters like delimiter from the Output data formatThe platform-independent way described above is based on CSV but could also be used in other formats like JSON and XML as long as the software support it, but the import procedure needs to be adjusted accordingly.Microsoft Excel​Use PowerQuery to load the URL directly into the CSV import without saving the file locally. Use the =WEBSERVICE function to load the API response directly into the sheet, but this will not parse the data; additional processing is required.Google Sheets​Use =IMPORT function to load the REST API endpoint and automatically parse the CSV format data into the cells. eg. =IMPORTDATA("https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csvOpenOffice Calc​Select the menu Insert -> Sheet From File, 2. In the Insert dialog, put the URL eg. https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&invert=true&output_format=csv in the File Name box at the bottom. Set the drop-down list next to that to Web Page Query and click Open. The Text Import dialog opens where you can change the defaults if needed.
