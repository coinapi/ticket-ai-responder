More information about the specific limits on each plan you can find on our Pricing page [1] and API Documentation [2].What are the risks of having multiple concurrent connections for Websocket? 
Currently, subscriptions have a soft limit of a single concurrent connection for Websocket. If you are using multiple concurrent connections, the risk is in the fact that the credentials are shared between environments, and this could lead to misuse of the key or leakage affecting the production environment. If the key is misused, it could trigger some of the hard limits regarding concurrency that could affect the production.References:[1] https://www.coinapi.io/Pricing [2] https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/websocket/general#limitsWas this section helpful?12345PreviousI received a reconnect message from WebsocketNextWhat are the time periods I can use for Exchange Rates and OHLCV?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
