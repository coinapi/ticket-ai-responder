After the period specified in message passes, the client must expect that the underlying WebSocket connection will be closed from the server-side. A new connection will automatically be established to a different server.The correct way of handling this event depends on the specific requirements of the integration, but we can define standard ways how to handle it:Wait for the connection to be closed and reconnectReconnect immediately after receiving the messageUpon receiving the message, establish a second connection, and subscribe to the same scope of data. When the first connection is disconnected, do not reconnect it and instead transparently switch the data streams between connections. This method requires more implementation as a transparent switch of the data stream must not break the sequence for streams published using the initial snapshot and update messages. To make sure the sequence is correct, the client must: (a) maintain a state by applying updates to snapshot or (b) buffer the data from the second connection and processing it at the transparent connection switch.Example JSON reconnect message is structured like this:{
"type":"reconnect"
"within_seconds": 10,
"before_time":"2020-08-06T19:19:09.7035429Z",
