Estimated monthly cost (30 days): 15.48 * 30 = 464.40 CUScenario 2: Weekly Analysis of Specific Trading Pairs​A user downloads data for 5 specific trading pairs (approximately 10% of the data) from BINANCE and COINBASE once a week:API Requests (per week):LIST requests: 6 (one for each data type per exchange)GET requests: 168 (estimated 10% of files for these exchanges)Total requests: 174CU for requests: (174 / 1,000) * 10 = 1.74 CUData Downloaded (10% of total volume, for 7 days):Limit Book: (8,627 + 4,978)  0.10 MB  1 CU/GB * 7 = 9.52 CUQuotes: (1,833 + 1,100)  0.10 MB  1 CU/GB * 7 = 2.05 CUTrades: (1,823 + 225)  0.10 MB  3 CU/GB * 7 = 4.31 CUTotal CU for data: 15.88 CUTotal CU for this scenario (per week): 1.74 + 15.88 = 17.62 CU
Estimated monthly cost (4 weeks): 17.62 * 4 = 70.48 CUScenario 3: Monthly Deep Dive on a Single Exchange​A user performs a comprehensive analysis of KRAKEN data (100% of KRAKEN data) for the past month:API Requests (per month):LIST requests: 3 (one for each data type)GET requests: 2,093 (all KRAKEN files)Total requests: 2,096CU for requests: (2,096 / 1,000) * 10 = 20.96 CUData Downloaded (100% of KRAKEN volume, for 30 days):Limit Book: 9,651 MB  1 CU/GB  30 = 289.53 CUQuotes: 2,506 MB  1 CU/GB  30 = 75.18 CUTrades: 21 MB  3 CU/GB  30 = 1.89 CUTotal CU for data: 366.60 CUTotal CU for this scenario (per month): 20.96 + 366.60 = 387.56 CUScenario 4: Daily Monitoring of Emerging Cryptocurrencies​A user tracks 20 emerging cryptocurrencies (approximately 5% of the data) across all exchanges daily:API Requests (per day):LIST requests: 18 (one for each data type per exchange)GET requests: 355 (estimated 5% of total files)Total requests: 373CU for requests: (373 / 1,000) * 10 = 3.73 CUData Downloaded (5% of total volume):Limit Book: (9,651 + 8,627 + 4,978 + 1,893 + 671 + 63)  0.05 MB  1 CU/GB = 1.27 CUQuotes: (2,506 + 1,833 + 1,100 + 525 + 192 + 50)  0.05 MB  1 CU/GB = 0.30 CUTrades: (1,823 + 225 + 21 + 4 + 3 + 1)  0.05 MB  3 CU/GB = 0.31 CUTotal CU for data: 1.88 CUTotal CU for this scenario (per day): 3.73 + 1.88 = 5.61 CU
Estimated monthly cost (30 days): 5.61 * 30 = 168.30 CUBest Practices for Cost Optimization​Focus on specific symbols or trading pairs relevant to your analysis to reduce data volume and costs.Use efficient querying to minimize unnecessary API calls, especially when checking for new data.Implement delta downloads to retrieve only new or updated data since your last download.Consider the frequency of data downloads based on your analysis needs. Daily downloads may not always be necessary.Cache downloaded data locally to avoid re-downloading unchanged historical data.Regularly review your data usage patterns and adjust your download strategy to optimize costs.Use LIST operations judiciously to minimize API requests when you know the exact files you need.Remember, data volumes and file counts may vary from day to day based on market activity and other factors. The scenarios presented here are based on the data from 2024-06-20 and should be considered as examples. Your actual usage and costs may differ.For more information on optimizing your usage and understanding your bill, please contact our support team.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousFlat FilesNextData & StructureBilling DimensionsPricingAPI RequestsData DownloadedConsumption UnitsDetailed Data VolumesRealistic Usage ScenariosScenario 1: Daily Download of Top Cryptocurrencies from Multiple ExchangesScenario 2: Weekly Analysis of Specific Trading PairsScenario 3: Monthly Deep Dive on a Single ExchangeScenario 4: Daily Monitoring of Emerging CryptocurrenciesBest Practices for Cost OptimizationCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
