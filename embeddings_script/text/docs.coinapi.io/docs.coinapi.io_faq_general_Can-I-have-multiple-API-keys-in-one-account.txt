It is important to note that the existence of each additional API Key for a subscription (enabled or disabled) above the plan quota is charged 1 USD per day, with a minimum of one dayThe multiple API keys can be limited via the configuration of the specific API key, for example, the specific API key newly created cannot overage or limit the specific API key to X number of requests to avoid causing issues for other keys. Increased security is one of the main benefits of having numerous API keys. Each key acts as an access point and particular identifier. Users can compartmentalize their access by making unique keys, which lowers the likelihood that a security breach will have a negative effect. The remaining keys are unaffected if one key is hacked, protecting sensitive information and reducing risks.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousCan I get the XML or CSV instead of the JSON output format?NextCan I have multiple subscriptions?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
