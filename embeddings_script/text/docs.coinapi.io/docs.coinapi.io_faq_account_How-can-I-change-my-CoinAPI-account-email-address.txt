After logging in, navigate to Subscriptions > Manage Subscriptions > Update InformationIf you do not have access to the account anymore, we can change the email address on your behalf as long as it is for personal use, or you are changing it to another employee's email under the same organization. If so, please submit a ticket here: https://support.coinapi.io/hc/en-us/requests/new There are some cases where we do NOT allow changing an account's email address. One case would be if you are requesting to change your account email address from a former organization to a new organization since you are no longer working there. E.g, you are an employee who worked for the company "X" and have an account with the email [email protected] wherein you purchased our products in behalf of the company, and you want to request to have the account's email address changed to [email protected] since you've changed workplaces; we would not allow this since it would basically mean that company Y would have the license to access the data of company X.Was this section helpful?12345PreviousHow I can update my credit card / billing information?NextHow can I get an invoice or receipt?Copyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
