"type": "hello",
"apikey": "73034021-SAMPLE-STARTUP-KEY",
"heartbeat": false,
"subscribe_data_type": ["quote"]
}You will receive:{
"message": "Forbidden - Your API key don't have privileges to data type 'quote'.",
"type": "error"
}This is because the Quote data type is not available for the Startup Subscription via WebSocket. If you'd like to upgrade your account, submit a request here: https://support.coinapi.io/hc/en-us/requests/newWas this section helpful?12345PreviousWhich assets or currencies are listed?NextCustomer AccountCopyright © 2024 COINAPI LTD or its affiliates.
