The CoinAPI Market Data API provides access to real-time and historical market data for cryptocurrencies. The API offers three interfaces: RESTful, WebSocket, and FIX. The RESTful interface is a stateless, request-response API that provides the widest range of data but is not capable of streaming. The WebSocket and FIX interfaces are stateful, publish-subscribe APIs that provide streaming of real-time market data. The API uses encryption on encrypted endpoints and follows best security practices. The SDK is available on GitHub and includes libraries and examples for various languages and environments. The API uses Snake case naming convention for variables and ISO 4217 currency code standard for fiat money identifications. Cryptocurrency assets are identified using codes used by the general public or adopted by the majority of exchanges. Exchange codes are identified by the specific exchange API and matching engine behind it. Numbers on the platform can have a maximum of 19 digits overall and up to 9 decimal places. Time values use the ISO 8601 standard and are provided in UTC time zone.

The WebSocket API provides real-time market data streaming using the Subscribe-Publish communication model. After establishing a WebSocket connection, a Hello message must be sent containing stream preferences, API key, and subscription details. The Hello message can be repeated to override the subscription scope without interrupting the WebSocket connection. Error handling should be implemented to receive and store error messages. The API access is subject to limits including request limit/IP, hello limit/IP, and concurrency limit/APIKey. Data buffering may occur if the client is unable to receive messages fast enough, resulting in a disconnect from the server. The current default queue size per connection is 131 072 messages. The WebSocket API supports HTTP1.0, HTTP1.1, HTTP2.0, and WebSocket protocols and complies with the v13 version of the WebSocket protocol documented in RFC6455. The client must respond with a Pong message each time a Ping message is received from the server, or the connection will be closed. The REST API can be used to list available symbols, exchanges, or assets for filtered streams. Authentication is required to access the API, and detailed instructions can be found in the authentication section of the documentation. The WebSocket API provides messages for trades, quotes, order book snapshots and updates, OHLCV updates, exchange rate updates, assets feed, exchanges feed, and symbols feed. The possible taker sides for trade messages are BUY, SELL, BUY_ESTIMATED, SELL_ESTIMATED, and UNKNOWN. The trade message contains information about the executed transaction, including the symbol ID, sequence number, time of the trade reported by the exchange, time when CoinAPI first received the trade from the exchange, unique trade identifier, price of the transaction, and base asset amount traded in the transaction. The quote message contains information about each update on the order book first best bid or ask level, including the symbol ID, sequence number, exchange time of the order book, CoinAPI time when the order book was received from the exchange, best asking price, volume resting on the best ask, best bidding price, and volume resting on the best bid. The order book snapshot and updates feed (book) contains information about the total amount of bids and asks aggregated by price level. The order book snapshots feed (book5, book20, book50) contains information about the first 5, 20, or 50 best bids or asks levels, respectively. The OHLCV updates feed contains information about the open, high, low, close, and volume traded per symbol on periods between 1SEC and 1MIN. The exchange rate updates feed contains information about the exchange rate updates (VWAP-24H). The assets feed contains information about the assets supported by CoinAPI, including the asset ID, name, type, volume traded in the last 24 hours, and other metadata. The exchanges feed contains information about the exchanges supported by CoinAPI, including the exchange ID, name, website, and other metadata. The symbols feed contains information about the symbols supported by CoinAPI, including the symbol ID, exchange ID, symbol type, asset ID base, asset ID quote, and other metadata. The WebSocket API also supports the book_l3 data type, which provides order-by-order updates for the order book in level 3 format. The book_l3 message contains information about each snapshot or update of the order book, including the symbol ID, sequence number, exchange time of the order book, CoinAPI time when the order book was received from the exchange, and the asks and bids levels. The book_l3 message does not aggregate any data, and every ask and bid corresponds to a passive order with information on the price and size of that order. The id can identify any order. If the data source is providing the maximum resolution of the order book on level 2, then the book_l3 data type will fallback to level 2, and the order IDs will be null or not provided. In that case, the order without an ID should be treated as a level 2 aggregated entry in the price queue.

The FIX API is a protocol for real-time exchange of financial information, initiated in 1992. It can be used to receive real-time market data and is an alternative to the WebSocket protocol. The FIX API implemented standard is FIX4.4. The API has endpoints for encrypted and unencrypted connections, with different configuration files provided for each. The production endpoint configuration parameters include the hostname, port for unencrypted and TLS connections, protocol version, and gateway timezone. SDKs and client libraries are recommended for using the FIX API and are available for various languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, and Go. Communication with the FIX gateway is secured by TLS protocol if the encrypted port is used. If the FIX protocol implementation does not support establishing a connection over a secure channel, a proxy such as stunnel can be used. The FIX API also supports oneZero Hub. All FIX messages are equipped with a Standard Header and Trailer, and the required fields for them are described in the document.

The Flat Files S3 API is a RESTful API that provides access to data stored in flat files. It is designed to be compliant with Amazon S3, allowing the use of existing infrastructure dedicated to Amazon S3. The API supports listing and downloading files, but not all Amazon S3 features. The flat files contain data such as quotes, trades, limit book snapshots, and OHLCV active consolidated data. The API supports HTTP1.0, HTTP1.1, and HTTP2.0 standards. It has two endpoints, one for production with encryption and one for production without encryption. The API uses XML format for responses and requires the "Accept: application/xml" header in HTTP requests. Authentication is required to access the API, and detailed instructions can be found in the authentication section of the documentation. The API supports several Amazon S3 REST API operations, including List objects and Download object. Error messages are returned in XML format and comply with Amazon S3 REST Error Responses. The AWS SDK and S3 Browser are compatible software that can be used to retrieve data from the Flat Files S3 API.
